<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span></h2>
<p>Ariel, quiet but alert, lay in her steamer chair, one of
the most inconspicuous of the several hundred passengers the
<i>Bermuda</i> was bringing to New York. No one would be likely
to look at her twice or give her a second thought, as she crouched
away from the March wind, insufficiently protected from the
cold by her nondescript tweed coat, and carelessly, casually bare-headed.
All about her on the deck were people of outstanding,
vivid types. The thing that had impressed Ariel about these fellow
passengers during the two days of the voyage was their
apparent self-sufficiency,&mdash;a gay, bright assurance of their own
significance, and the reasonableness, even the inevitableness, of
their being what and where they were. The very children appeared
to take it quite as a matter of course that they should
come skimming over the Atlantic in a mammoth boat-hotel
while they played their games, read their books and ate their
meals,&mdash;just like that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Ariel took nothing as a matter of course, and she never had
from the minute of earliest memory. Her proclivity to wonder
and to delight was as organic as her proclivity to breathe. But
now it was neither delight nor wonder but an aching suspense
that quivered at the back of her mind. She thought, &ldquo;If Father
were here! If it weren&rsquo;t alone, this adventure! New York Harbor
at last! <i>I</i>&mdash;Ariel! But it isn&rsquo;t real. There&rsquo;s no substance. It
<i>was</i> to have happened and been wonderful, but this is paler
than our imagining of it. The shadow of our imagining. Oh, it&rsquo;s
I who have died and not Father. Where he is, whatever he is
doing, it&rsquo;s still real with him. With Father it would be always
real,&mdash;alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A steward came up the deck, carrying rugs and a book for
the woman who had occupied the chair next to Ariel&rsquo;s during
the two days&rsquo; voyage. Two children with their nurse trailed behind.
Ariel&rsquo;s glance barely touched the group and returned to
New York&rsquo;s terraced, dream-world sky line. But she was glad
that these people had come up on deck and would be near her
during the little while left of ship life. It did not matter that
they would remain unaware of her until the very end. It was
more interesting, being interested in them, than having them
interested in her. And there was no reason on earth why they
should be interested in her. It never entered Ariel&rsquo;s head that
there was.</p>
<p>Joan Nevin, the woman, was tall, copper haired and eyelashed,
and graceful with a lithe, body-conscious kind of gracefulness,
of fashion, perhaps, more than of nature. Her sleek fur
coat, her high-heeled, elegant pumps&mdash;even the close dark hat,
flaring back from her copper eyebrows&mdash;these seemed to motivate
her gait and her postures. She was, perhaps, more pliable
to them than they to her. But Ariel did not mind this, although
she realized it. It was wonderful, in its way, fascinating by
strangeness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>To tell the truth, Mrs. Nevin interested her more at the moment
than the unknown, beautiful harbor at which she appeared
to be gazing. And no aching longing for her father&rsquo;s
sharing of this interest could turn it dreamlike, for her father
could never share it, alive or dead. Fashionable women, even at
a distance, bored him. But how did a woman like that feel, Ariel
wondered, about her so finished and catered-to beauty, and her
easy self-sufficiency? And how did it feel to have two burnished,
curled children that were one&rsquo;s very own, to love, to live for, to
play with? How wonderful if Ariel herself had had children
of her own to play with and dance with on their beach, while
her father was alive and she could still have gloried in them,
before the sense of unreality had settled like a thin dust over
unshared happiness!</p>
<p>The Nevins and the nurse had come the length of the deck
now, and were standing near her, but not taking their chairs,
and oddly silent. Still, she would not look directly at them to
discover the reason. If she looked into their faces she might become
visible to them. So far, these two past days, Ariel had kept
herself wrapped in a cloud of invisibility, she felt, merely by
not meeting other eyes. She was shy of contacts, ever since her
father&rsquo;s death; and the aching, hurting suspense at the back of
her mind, which was caused by dread of the near approaching
meeting with her father&rsquo;s friend, had only intensified her desire
for invisibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>As for Mrs. Nevin, until this instant she had been nearly as
unaware of Ariel as Ariel supposed her to be. She had looked at
her once or twice in the beginning, to wonder whether it was
a child, a girl or a woman who occupied the neighboring chair,
but quickly decided that such speculation was waste of time
since the one thing certain was that Ariel&rsquo;s age didn&rsquo;t matter,
since she was obviously&mdash;nobody. From that decision she had
returned to social obliviousness, lying back for hours at a time,
wrapped up preciously by her eager cabin steward in two fur-lined
rugs, which could not have been hired for the passage but
must be her own expensive property, following with absorption
the fine print of a thick novel by some one named Aldous Huxley.
Now and then she would lift languid but brilliant eyes and
gaze for a while at the flying sea. That was all, for after the first
half hour on board she had not thought it worth her while to
waste that brilliant languid gaze on any other fellow-passenger
more than on Ariel.</p>
<p>But now she remained standing by Ariel&rsquo;s chair, as though
with some intention, and Ariel had finally to look up and meet,
for the first time, in a direct exchange of glance, those brilliant,
mahogany-colored eyes set wide apart under their strongly
arched coppery brows, and it was, without doubt, a breathtaking
moment. But it was the steward who was speaking, and
his tone was seriously accusatory. &ldquo;You are occupying the lady&rsquo;s
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right. In the excitement of at last being almost in,
so near the landing, Ariel had neglected to make sure of her
own name&mdash;Ariel Clare&mdash;on the slip of pink cardboard stuck
into the holder on the chair&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she muttered,
rose and was off like a bird. The steward&rsquo;s eyelids just flickered
as she brushed past him in exquisite, smooth flight. But the
flicker was not because the steward had recognized that the
nondescript, pale, young girl had turned exquisite with motion.
He blinked merely because her decision to depart and the
departure had been so strangely, almost weirdly, simultaneous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuck it in at the foot more, please. Very well. That will do.
Thank you.&rdquo; Ariel, out by the deck rail, heard Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s
low, but carrying voice directing and dismissing her eager slave.
&ldquo;It was unkind and perfectly needless,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Any chair
would have done her just as well for the next few minutes until
we land. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, though. I won&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>But she decided to go for a last time up to the sun deck. She
could watch the boat docking from there just as well&mdash;better
than from here&mdash;and discover her father&rsquo;s friend among the
crowds on the dock just as easily. She was through with deck
chairs and pink cards and haughty neighbors, for this voyage,
anyway. But she wished she could wipe out from her memory
forever those brilliant, indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>She found the sun deck surprisingly clear of passengers. The
deck chairs there had been almost all gathered up and were
now being stacked into corners to wait for the return voyage and
new voyagers. Ariel crossed to the rail and began to search, eyes
narrowed against the cold sunlight glinting from cold waves,
for her father&rsquo;s friend in the dark mass at the edge of the pier
over there, which only now was beginning to show itself as
separate individuals waiting for the docking of the <i>Bermuda</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I care so much that just a stranger scorns me and
finds me in the way, how am I going to help caring terribly if
the Weymans don&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo; she asked herself, baffled that
by no act of will could she slow the beating of her excited heart
or cool the fire she felt in her cheeks. &ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s so tall I must
soon make him out, if he&rsquo;s really come to meet me. I&rsquo;ll wave
when he catches sight of me.... Forget myself.... Wave for
Father.... Pretend it&rsquo;s Father seeing Hugh after all these
years, and not I. <i>I will not be strange and shy.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She imagined her father in her place, leaning on the rail,&mdash;blond,
blue-eyed, chuckling softly and searching with anticipatory
eagerness for the high-held dark head of his friend which
would stand out any minute now above the crowd of people.
And Gregory Clare was so living, so vibrant with life and joy in
life, that when the people on the pier, looking up, first caught
sight of him, not a soul of them but would ask himself &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
that rather wonderful-looking person?&rdquo; and an involuntary
light, a contagion of life, would ripple answeringly in the lifted
faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The wind whipped a strand of Ariel&rsquo;s hair smartingly across
her eyes. She shut them against the pain for an instant, and
when she opened them again her father had gone. She was alone.
She was only herself now, shy, trivial, pale,&mdash;a worm that
wondered about the impression she was going to make on her
father&rsquo;s friend and his family. And all the time there was New
York&rsquo;s sky line to glory in.</p>
<p>Well, even though she was so mean a person, so little and
mean in her hidden self, perhaps she could do something to
improve the outward girl. She could at least put on her hat,
stand straight&mdash;not flattened against the rail like a weak piece
of straw in the wind,&mdash;hold her chin up&mdash;her chin that was
like her father&rsquo;s, pointed, but firm. She pulled out the hat from
one of the pockets of the tweed coat, pushed her blown hair up
under its brim and pulled it well down on her head. It was a
notable hat, once well on, and whatever it did for the inner girl,
it certainly changed the whole air of the outer, visible girl. It
was French felt of an exceptionally fine quality, and green, the
shade of Bermuda waters when they are stillest. Her father
had bought it for her one day in St. George&rsquo;s. He said he had
got it for a song at a stupid sale. It was one of the very few hats
of her life, as it happened, because her father thought hats in
general ridiculous and more suitable for monkeys than for men
and women. But this hat was different. He realized that, when
he caught it from the corner of his eye, passing the shop window.
It sang Ariel. And he had got it for a &ldquo;song.&rdquo; But not the
feather that was tacked to the brim, ruffling jewel notes in the
wind. That had dropped <i>from</i> a song, not been bought at all.
He had picked it up on the beach almost at their door as he
came back one afternoon, not many weeks ago, from what was
to prove his last swim. No bird from which this feather could
have dropped had ever been seen on the island, so far as any
ornithologist knew. But here was the feather, in spite of that.
It was magic, then. And it magic&rsquo;d the hat. It pointed the fact
that Ariel&rsquo;s eyes, rather narrow, but nice friendly eyes, and free
as the day from the malice that one sometimes detects even in
the pleasantest children&rsquo;s eyes, were as green as itself,&mdash;as green
as Bermuda waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Now those eyes had discerned one head that did top all the
other heads on the approaching pier, and it very probably was
Hugh&rsquo;s. But she had decided last night, or early this morning&mdash;she
had slept very little&mdash;that she would begin, at least, by
calling him &ldquo;Mr. Weyman.&rdquo; For it was five years and a few
months over since they had seen each other. His father too had
died, since that far-away time, and he had left law school to
become the support of his mother and younger brother and
sister. At twenty-five, still a student without responsibilities,
when they had entertained him at the studio, he had seemed a
boy. But at thirty now, and having, as she had, encountered
death, could he be the same at all, any more than she was the
same fourteen-year-old girl that he must be remembering? She
thought not; and whether she was shaking with chill from the
March wind or from apprehension of change in her father&rsquo;s
friend, she did not know. But she was shaking, miserably, and
a strand of hair had escaped again and was stinging her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span></h2>
<p>He had been in Bermuda that time for part of his Christmas
holidays, along with his mother and young sister. But the
mother and sister had never appeared on the Clares&rsquo; beach, never
come with Hugh to the studio. Hugh&rsquo;s own arrival there was
the merest accident. One mid-morning he came pushing his
rented bicycle across the fields to their beach, which he had
glimpsed from a high spot on the road to St. George&rsquo;s, intending
a solitary swim in the shadow of their rocks. Only he did
not know that they were their rocks or that there was a house
at all, hidden away on the slope of purple cedars. He passed
within a few yards of the studio, without sensing its presence,
and went coolly down to the beach with the intention of undressing
for his swim in the very seclusion where Gregory Clare
was at the moment in the middle of painting a picture.</p>
<p>The artist, hearing the careless approach to the sacred privacy
of his working place, rose wrathfully to drive the intruder away.
But it turned out that he did not resume his brushes and his
palette again until he had joined the young man in a noon-hour
swim in the emerald waters. For Hugh had succeeded in doing
more that morning than blunder on to private property and
interrupt the creation of a picture; he had blundered into a
friendship with Gregory Clare, the artist, Ariel&rsquo;s father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The sudden friend knew next to nothing about painting.
That was evidenced by his awkward silences once he had come
into the studio and stood looking with unconcealed bewilderment
at the dozens of canvases stacked around the walls and
against the chairs and tables. But the young man&rsquo;s ignorance
did not hinder Gregory Clare from talking art to him. He
dragged forward the canvases, one after another, making rapid
and brilliant criticisms of them himself in the face of Hugh&rsquo;s
blank silences, propounding exactly what it was that made each
picture&rsquo;s strength or weakness in its stab at beauty. And all the
while Hugh looked from the artist to his paintings and listened,
dark head slightly bent, but with a hawklike alertness in
its poise that gave Clare, and even Ariel, watching, a sense of
balanced keenness.</p>
<p>Ariel and her father prepared the studio meals by turns, and
this day of Hugh&rsquo;s appearance happened to be Ariel&rsquo;s day as
cook. Hugh was more articulate about food, it soon transpired,
than about art, and had intelligent praise for pungent soup and
crisp salad. But though that was what he was at ease about and
could speak of, his real interest was, Ariel saw, all in Gregory
Clare and his rushing passionate talk concerning the paintings.
He seemed scarcely conscious of Ariel, the lanky young girl in
a faded green smock, with hair a pale wave on her shoulders,
who had cooked the luncheon and soon so quietly cleared the
table and then disappeared, dissolving, so far as he was concerned,
perhaps, into the white, hot Bermuda afternoon. She
knew that he was glad to be left alone with her wonderful
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>After that, for the remaining days of his vacation on the
island, Hugh was constantly at the studio. He must have entirely
deserted his mother and sister, and he never bothered to
speak of them again, after his first mention of the fact that
there were such persons with him at the hotel in Hamilton.
Even the morning that his boat was to sail he appeared at the
studio, inviting himself to breakfast with the Clares, in spite of
having had a farewell dinner with them the night before. And
that morning, at last, he commented on Gregory Clare&rsquo;s work,
or at least on one of his canvases. It was time for him to go, they
had told him, if he was to make his boat; but he delayed. And
suddenly, in an embarrassed manner he turned back from the
door, when they really thought he was off, and standing in front
of an easel with a just finished painting on it blurted, &ldquo;I really
like this one, &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo; the best of the lot, Clare, if you don&rsquo;t mind
my saying so. It&rsquo;s the light that makes it so extraordinary, isn&rsquo;t it?
It beats out on you. Makes you squint. It&rsquo;s the first time I ever
saw light, or even felt it; I&rsquo;m sure of that. Your picture has
taught me what the sun hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He laughed, self-depreciatively,
and added almost defiantly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great stuff, I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel&rsquo;s father said nothing. He stood by the table in the
wide window where they had just breakfasted, jingling some
coin in the pockets of his white duck trousers, and kept a
smiling silence. Ariel wanted to cry, &ldquo;Oh, do go; hurry, Hugh,
now, or you&rsquo;ll miss your boat!&rdquo; But Hugh seemed to be waiting
for something, wanting to say more, and she kept still. After
a minute he got it out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like awfully to take this picture
home with me, Clare. Now. I&rsquo;ve written out a check for a
thousand dollars&mdash;did it last night&mdash;just on the chance you&rsquo;d
sell. I don&rsquo;t know anything, of course, about the prices you put
on your stuff. But this is exactly one quarter of my year&rsquo;s allowance,
and all the actual cash I can put my hands on now. If
you <i>will</i> sell, and the price is higher&mdash;and you can wait for
the rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Hugh was not looking at the artist or at Ariel or even at
the picture by this time. His abashed gaze was toward the sea,
while he waited for Gregory Clare to answer.</p>
<p>The painting was the one that Hugh&rsquo;s intrusion on their
beach had interrupted. It was a bit of a corner of the beach
seen at high noon. Everything was sun-stilled, even the water,
except for the figure of Ariel herself, who was dancing in the
violet heat-glow above the rocks. But although it was Clare&rsquo;s
daughter, the artist had not seen her as human, since he placed
her dancing feet on air, not earth. And the faded smock&mdash;the
smock she was wearing the day Hugh had first come to the
studio&mdash;in the painting had found its vanished color at the
same time that the hot sunlight struck all color from her partly
averted face. Gregory Clare might have called this painting
&ldquo;Ariel Dances,&rdquo; but instead he called it &ldquo;Noon.&rdquo; And it was
Noon, actually. Ariel was only the heart-pulse at the center
of the otherwise still, white light.</p>
<p>But one thousand dollars! The listening girl was stunned,
strangely taken aback. Her father, however, did not show
even surprise. He merely chuckled and jingled the coins in
his pockets like music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you, Hugh,&rdquo; he murmured, after a minute.
&ldquo;You show your taste. &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; is my best, quite easily my best,
so far. I&rsquo;m awfully glad that you see it. I&rsquo;ve felt all along,
though, that you were seeing an awful lot, really. And to sacrifice
one fourth of your year&rsquo;s income to beauty won&rsquo;t hurt
you. Indeed, it might very well happen to save your soul. Even
so, I advise you to take more time. Think it over. Write me.
I can always ship you the thing. I won&rsquo;t part with it for less
than the thousand, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>But the fledgling art connoisseur was not to be put off. Until
now he had been in regard to the studio, the people in it, and
the paintings, the soaring, silent hawk. This, however, was his
instant of darting and seizing. He had carried &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; off with
him, under his arm, unwrapped, and made the boat without a
second to lose. And amazingly soon thereafter Gregory Clare
and his daughter had got themselves to Europe, which meant
Paris; and once in Paris, Gregory swept Ariel straight to the
Louvre, where she sat or promenaded with him as long as
Hugh&rsquo;s thousand dollars lasted, gazing on cold, dim old pictures,
but with her father&rsquo;s warm, vibrant artist&rsquo;s hand often
on hers. It had been Ariel&rsquo;s one adventure beyond Bermuda,
until this present adventure: alone, and her father dead.</p>
<p>Hugh had never come back to Bermuda and his letters were
infrequent. Gregory Clare&rsquo;s own letters were, from the beginning,
almost non-existent, because that was his casual way
with friends. One of Hugh&rsquo;s first letters told them of the sudden
death of his father, and that Hugh&rsquo;s plan for making himself
a lawyer was frustrated by the necessity of getting as quickly
as was possible into his father&rsquo;s niche in the business world.
But Hugh did not use the term &ldquo;frustration,&rdquo; and there was,
indeed, no touch of bitterness in the communication. The hint
of a real grief was there, and a suggestion, somehow, that his
father could not have been so exceptional in business capacity
as in personality and character, since at the time of his death he
had pretty well gone through his inheritance and was leaving
his family little but a name. The name, however, was not
clouded by his purely financial inability and was now of invaluable
assistance to Hugh, who was being quite spoiled&mdash;according
to his own account&mdash;by Wall Street associates of his father
who had taken him into a big bond house on a floor several
stories removed from the bottom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>After that the studio heard from Hugh Weyman, bond salesman,
at longer and longer intervals. Clare was afraid that his
friend was absorbed by business, a dire calamity to befall a
young man who had once been rejoiced to spend one fourth
of his year&rsquo;s income on the pigment splashed on a four foot by
three foot bit of canvas. And now, for a year past, no word of
any sort had come from Hugh, until the morning of the artist&rsquo;s
death. And although her father seemed actually to have held
his death at bay those last few days, merely in the hope of
that last letter, he did not show it to Ariel. But he explained
to her, faintly and with an odd, smiling satisfaction, after he
had read it to himself, and she had carefully burned it under
his direction in the studio fireplace, that it was an answer to a
letter from himself written within the week.</p>
<p>His letter had told Hugh that he was near death, and asked
him to invite Ariel to visit the Weymans for the latter part
of the winter, while Charlie Frye, a young disciple of Clare&rsquo;s,
who had spent the last few months in Bermuda working with
him, was arranging for an exhibition and sale of Clare&rsquo;s paintings
in New York. Ariel was being left only a very few hundred
dollars, but the sale of the pictures ought to carry her
through any number of farther years, until, in any case, she
should either have married or have prepared herself for some
profession. Their doctor, here in Bermuda, would be Ariel&rsquo;s
actual guardian in law. Charlie Frye would be her business
manager in a practical sense. Would Hugh make himself her
host and friend for the coming difficult period? Neither the
kindly doctor, nor the young and enthusiastic Frye seemed to
Clare quite the man to do precisely this for his girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>That was the substance of the artist&rsquo;s letter as told to Ariel,
and Hugh&rsquo;s reply had been an instant promise to receive Ariel
and with his mother&rsquo;s help do anything for her that was in his
power. Gregory could rely on his friend. Only, the doctor must
keep him informed of his patient&rsquo;s health, and it had better be
the doctor who should arrange for Ariel&rsquo;s coming to New
York if the end that Clare had prophesied did transpire.</p>
<p>That was the substance of Hugh&rsquo;s letter. And Gregory Clare
had finished explaining it all to Ariel as she stood watching
the last scraps of it curl into charred blackness in the grate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t worry, darling,&rdquo; he gasped, when her silence
had become prolonged, &ldquo;for when you remember that the
only picture I ever even thought of selling brought us one thousand
dollars ... and now there are two hundred of them
soon to be up for sale in New York ... where there&rsquo;s so much
wealth ... I&rsquo;ve marked those Charlie&rsquo;s to drown out beyond
the reef to-morrow&mdash;the ones that aren&rsquo;t really good enough,
you know&mdash;and it leaves, even at that, <i>two hundred</i> pictures.
Suppose they only bring half the price of the first one each....
Why, even that is wealth, my dear....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Father! What does it matter?&rdquo; She was dismayed
that his last strength was being given to such trivialities.</p>
<p>But he struggled on, with harshly drawn breaths. &ldquo;Funny
why I&rsquo;m trusting you to Hugh, beyond every one else! I suppose
it&rsquo;s because he saw that &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; was the best of the lot....
He did see, remember? And he sacrificed something for that
seeing. A quarter of his income, wise boy! He understood
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo;&mdash;so he&rsquo;ll understand you, Ariel, darling, my dearest&mdash;sweetest.
He may have changed, but hardly so much&mdash;for</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&lsquo;... Fortunate they</p>
<p class="t0">Who, though once only and then far away,</p>
<p class="t0">Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Beauty&rsquo;s sandal, that was. Do you remember the sonnet?
Well&mdash;Hugh&rsquo;s one of those Fortunate.... I&rsquo;ve never seen in
any one else&rsquo;s face what I saw in his that morning when he
stood, looking at &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; and saying it showed him what the
sun hadn&rsquo;t....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father! Hush! Don&rsquo;t try to speak any more. Rest!&rdquo;
Ariel was kneeling by his bed, pressing his hands, hot with her
tears for all their waning life, against her cheeks. &ldquo;Everything
will be all right. There is <i>nothing</i>, nothing at all to worry about.
Only never forget me. Don&rsquo;t go so far that you forget me.
Don&rsquo;t go far. Not far....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He understood all that she meant, all that was beyond saying,
and he promised with a gesture never to let death&rsquo;s freedom
intrigue him into adventure that would leave the memory and
the love of his girl out. But he looked over her head at the
doctor who had been standing all these minutes in the window,
and the doctor nodded. The nod seemed a signal for something
the two men had previously agreed on, as it was. And
Gregory Clare, acting on the signal, which had come finally
and at last, said to Ariel in the voice of authority which he so
seldom had used during their life together, &ldquo;Now, beloved,
it is time you went away. Go down to the beach, please. Give
my love and my farewell to the light, to earth light, and to our
beach. I shall be gone when you come back, and you are not to
see me die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel rose to obey. There was no question about obedience
for it was the voice of Death itself which had commanded her.
But at the door her father spoke again, and she had thought
never to hear him speak again, and it was the voice of Life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash; No. I was wrong. We made a mistake, Doctor. A
woman is bound to have plenty to do with pain&mdash;before she&rsquo;s
through. I think, Ariel, we&rsquo;ll have this pain together.... If
you like&mdash;darling. I won&rsquo;t send you out of it. Doctor, I want
to be with my girl when she bears her first anguish&mdash;which
will be my agony, as it happens. It&rsquo;s yourself, Friend, I want
away. No more need of you till it&rsquo;s over. Ariel will help
me. Your arm under my shoulder, dear. That&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;right....&rdquo;
But he had not sent the doctor with his love and
his farewell to their beach and the earth light, for not every
one can take such a message, and Ariel would do it later.</p>
<p>The doctor sat down in the loggia, within hearing if Ariel
should cry out for him. He smoked cigarettes for an hour,
throwing their stubs angrily one after another out into the
roses, and did not approve; for Ariel seemed only a child to
him, and this was terrible. Perhaps she had been a child when
he, the doctor, had been made to leave her face to face with
physical agony and final death in the studio. But when, at last,
he saw her coming out into the strong white sunlight and
knew that she brought with her the stark word he waited, she
was a woman. The doctor would have been blind not to have
recognized the mark of that maturity on her face. And this
forced and sudden growth had happened to the girl because of
her father&rsquo;s colossal selfishness, he believed, stumbling forward
to his feet and reaching both his hands for hers. But when
they were close in his, those young, live hands, the doctor knew
nothing for certain any more about the business; it might be
imagination in Clare&mdash;colossal imagination&mdash;that had made
him act so, not a grain of selfishness in it. For to his amazed
relief the slight hands he held were steadier, stronger, at the
moment, than his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span></h2>
<p>She would certainly call him Mr. Weyman, not Hugh.
And the first thing she would say would be a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for
his invitation to visit him; for she had not written the note of
acceptance herself but left it to Doctor Hazzard. And now she
thought that if only she had written herself, it would somehow
have prepared the way better for the instant, almost reached
now, when the boat would be close enough to the pier for the
tall man to discern her, to meet her eyes, and for her to wave
a greeting.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, she woke to the fact that that was not
Hugh at all. The sun on the water had dazzled her. It was an
older man, heavily bearded, foreign looking. He was taller,
and certainly much broader than Hugh would ever be. She
had never seen any one, except perhaps her father, stand out
from a crowd as this man was standing out from it. Even from
a distance his personality had reached her, impressed itself, and
this had nothing to do with his unusual bulk and height. No,
it was personality, bodiless, that reached across the water, and
absorbed her attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The big man had pushed his way through the crowd and
soon stood right out at the edge of the pier, his head thrown
back, eagerly scanning the <i>Bermuda&rsquo;s</i> decks. Then, as the ship
sidled a few yards nearer, he raised his big, long arms straight
above his head in sudden cyclonic greeting, and laughed up a
big laugh of gleaming white teeth almost into Ariel&rsquo;s face.
But it couldn&rsquo;t be herself he was so ardently saluting, and she
turned quickly to see who was near her, here on the sun deck.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Nevin again. She was there, with her children,
almost at Ariel&rsquo;s shoulder. And she was smiling down at the
bearded man. But the children were looking at Ariel. She had
so plainly refrained from inviting their acquaintance during
the voyage that they had not once tried to force a contact. She
had seemed to their sensitive child perceptions to be out with
the flying fish and the dip of the waves, more than in her
steamer chair beside their mother, for that was where her gaze
had lived. But the small green feather, which fluttered its down
incessantly against the brim of her hat, had all the while had
a life, they felt, quite apart from its wearer&rsquo;s. It had been a veritable
fairy flag, waving recognition and good will to them
whenever their play brought them near. And now Ariel had
turned so quickly that she had caught the children&rsquo;s glances
of camaraderie with the feather. And suddenly she took in
<i>their</i> magic, realized it, as they had from the very first recognized
and taken in the magic of the feather her father had
found and given her. She was aware of the children&mdash;really
aware&mdash;at last.</p>
<p>That was all that it needed. They saw her face lose its
abstraction, come as alive as the wind-dancing feather. Ariel&rsquo;s
eyes and lips smiled. Everything went golden. The children&rsquo;s
hearts fluttered as though <i>they</i> were magic feathers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>But even now when Ariel&rsquo;s smile had taught them all that
there was to know about her the children did not rush upon
her. They came slowly, with sensitive delicacy, as children will,&mdash;but
for all the delicacy, with an air of deep, almost frightening
assurance. Each child, taking one of Ariel&rsquo;s cold, ungloved
hands, pressed close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in, in another minute,&rdquo; Ariel faltered, tremulously
and almost beneath her breath, as if to warn them of
the unreasonableness of this sudden, overwhelming intimacy
which must be lost almost as soon as consummated. &ldquo;Look.
There goes the gangplank. And there&rsquo;s some one&mdash;some one
I know.&rdquo; Suddenly, and when she had really forgotten his very
existence, she had seen Hugh.</p>
<p>To her relief this first sight assured her that he had not
changed in the five years. He was the same Hugh, her father&rsquo;s
eager, quiet friend of the hawklike dark head, poised, alert, on
shoulders that for all their breadth had an indefinable air of
elegance about them. In his darkness and poise he was in direct
contrast to the blond-bearded person gesticulating to Mrs.
Nevin. Hugh stood beside this giant, looking up at the decks
of the <i>Bermuda</i> as he was looking up, but with a difference.
Without excitement, but rapidly, his eyes were traveling along
the tiers of decks and the bending faces. In another minute he
would get to the last deck and find what he sought, Ariel.
Their eyes would meet and in the meeting remember everything
of that sunlit week of five years ago. Under one arm
she saw that he was carrying, tucked there as though it might
be any ordinary parcel, a big bunch of English violets. They
were for her, of course. So why had she ever been shy, afraid?
She had forgotten the children and was bending forward over
the rail, waiting with genuine gayety now the moment of his
recognition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>But just before his glance, in its methodical journey, came to
her deck, she had her first sense of change in him. After all,
he was different, a little, from the Bermuda days. There was
a moody hunger in his eyes, and something gaunt, unfed, in
the face that she had remembered only as keen, without shadows.
But his face would light up in the old way when he
discovered her. This might be his look when alone and unaware
of friends near.</p>
<p>The light, however, when it came, was not for Ariel. It was
Mrs. Nevin his searching glance was halted by, and the glory
that transfigured the dark, uplifted face took away Ariel&rsquo;s
breath.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nevin laughed down a greeting, and murmured above
her breath, so that Ariel caught the words, &ldquo;Now how&rsquo;d he
know I was coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It flashed through Ariel&rsquo;s mind that much reading of Aldous
Huxley during the voyage, if that was the author&rsquo;s name,
must have dulled Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s perceptions, if she did not see
that it had needed surprise as well as joy, so to shatter Hugh&rsquo;s
reserve.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nevin called to her children, who still pressed against
Ariel, holding her hands, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Uncle Hugh, darlings.
Wave to him. See, he has found us. Isn&rsquo;t it nice of him to meet
our boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh returned the children&rsquo;s obedient salutes, but the light
was gone. Was it merely habitual reserve returning to duty, or
had the sudden delight really as suddenly died? Ariel knew instantly
and intuitively that these children were not related to
Hugh, although Mrs. Nevin had called him uncle. Now he
had to see herself, wedged in between the children. She tried
to smile down at him, to help him to his recognition, but her
lips were as cold as the wind in her face. She could not smile.
His glance was passing her by as casually as it had passed a
hundred other bending faces above the deck rails. After a little
farther search it returned to Mrs. Nevin who bent forward,
held out her gloved hands, and called down, &ldquo;Toss, Hugh!
Toss! I can catch!&rdquo;&mdash;laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>For just an instant Hugh appeared puzzled. Then he remembered
the violets jammed under his arm, and tossed them
up to the waiting hands. It was an expert toss, and Ariel remembered
how her father had once drawn her attention to the
fact that all Hugh&rsquo;s motions were expert, effective. The smell
of the violets, so near now, was dizzying her with nostalgia. She
wanted to cry out, &ldquo;They are mine, not yours. He brought
them for me. He never even knew you were on the boat!&rdquo;
But instead, she loosened the children&rsquo;s hands from hers and
turned her back to the pier. Through the darkness of tears she
moved away toward the stairs, with the intention of making
sure that her baggage had left her stateroom. It would be time
enough to identify herself to Hugh, who had forgotten her,
when she came off the ship.</p>
<p>She was almost the last person down the gangway. Hugh
was there at the foot, looking anxious, for he had begun to be
afraid he had missed Ariel Clare in the disembarking crowd.
But even when she stopped by him and with head back, so
that he might see her face plainly under the brim of her green
hat, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ariel, Mr. Weyman. It&rsquo;s kind of you to have
me and to meet me,&rdquo; he looked doubtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he murmured, obviously taken aback and surprised.
&ldquo;Why, I thought you were the twins&rsquo; nurse!&rdquo; But even as he
spoke he saw that it was indeed Ariel, standing with the look
that she used to wear sometimes before vanishing away into
hot, white sunlight, years and years ago when he was young
and she was an unreal fairy creature, hovering almost unnoticed
somewhere on the edges of his first deep experience of
friendship. Of course this was she; how hadn&rsquo;t he known?
&ldquo;But the twins were clinging to you like burrs, weren&rsquo;t they!&rdquo;
he insisted, explaining his stupidity. &ldquo;It looked, you know,
as if you belonged, body and soul, to Persis and Nicky. But
of course it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet even now when he was at last shaking hands with her
Hugh was looking over her head at a group of people a few
yards away, with Mrs. Nevin at its center. The big man, the
foreign-looking, bearded personage who had come to meet
Mrs. Nevin, was beside her, his hand on her arm. He was
possessive in his bearing, and openly exuberant that the lady
had landed and was for the moment, at least, under his protection.
And now a great sheaf of yellow roses in Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s
arms quite obscured the violets, if, indeed, she still had them.
Ariel was conscious that Hugh returned his attention to herself
with an almost painful effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your luggage will be under C,&rdquo; he unnecessarily informed
her, and then added with a sudden access of responsibility,
&ldquo;This is the way. We&rsquo;ll do our best to speed things up in spite
of the unlucky popularity of your letter. We&rsquo;ll grab tea somewhere
then, and get right along to Wild Acres, where Mother
and Anne are waiting for us. They would have come in to
meet you with me&mdash;Anne would, anyway&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve got
another visitor with us&mdash;Prescott Enderly, the novelist. Know
his stuff?&rdquo; And all the while he was skillfully guiding her
through a milling crowd of over-anxious people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span></h2>
<p>The younger Weymans had been skiing most of that
afternoon with their guest, Prescott Enderly. Although Enderly
was Glenn Weyman&rsquo;s intimate at Yale and only a year
or so older, he was a novelist of some notoriety. He had written
only one novel, it is true, but during the past summer&mdash;the
book was published in the spring&mdash;it had skyrocketed to fame.
Its publishers described it in their advertising as an honest
and fearless description of the private life of almost any averagely
intelligent college man. Its author was now&mdash;except for
the necessity of doing some classwork if he were to graduate
this year, and taking time out for being a lion&mdash;working on
a second novel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when they returned home from
their skiing in the snowy country around the Weymans&rsquo;
estate on the Hudson. Glenn went up to his room to lounge
and read until dinner time, but Anne staggered with an exaggerated
air of fatigue into the library, and Enderly followed
her. A fire, recently lighted, blazed its invitation from the far
end of the long room, and although it was not yet quite dark
outside, the heavy velvet curtains had already been drawn
across the windows and several table lamps were glowing
through rich, soft-colored shades. Enderly, without asking
Anne&rsquo;s leave, went the round of the lamps, turning off their
lights. But even without the lamps the freshly lighted fire kept
the room alive and awake. Anne threw herself into the exact
center of the deep divan which was drawn up before the fireplace,
and Enderly, without hesitation or a word, settled himself
close at her side. She leaned her head against the back of
the divan, shut her eyes, and murmured &ldquo;Hello. Where&rsquo;d you
come from?&rdquo; as though already half asleep. Her voice was
oddly, boyishly deep, but with a slight catch in it which turned
it thrillingly feminine. Enderly liked Anne&rsquo;s voice: it was the
thing that had attracted him to her in the beginning, when he
had met her at a house party in New Haven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve been tobogganing, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;ve I. Funny. There was a creature along with us,&mdash;name
of Prescott Enderly. Thinks he&rsquo;s a novelist and quite important,
you know. Perhaps he can write, but he&rsquo;s not so good
in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Well, darling, you are magnificent in the snow,
so it doesn&rsquo;t matter about me. You were a gorgeous red bird,
always flying somewhere ahead in the face of a dead, white
world. Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne opened her eyes and glanced down at her flannel
skirt, ruby in the firelight. &ldquo;But yesterday, Pressy, you insisted
I was a flame. I&rsquo;d really rather be a flame than a bird.
Aren&rsquo;t I more a flame? Say, &lsquo;yes&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand over her two hands which were clasped on
her crossed knees. But he laid it casually, looking into the fire.
Her eyelids flickered at the contact, but her hands did not stir
or tremble. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a flame in the house&mdash;now. Close like
this.... But a bird in the open. How&rsquo;s that? Satisfied?&rdquo; His
cheek just brushed hers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not satisfied,&rdquo; she insisted huskily,&mdash;and then pretended
to yawn, because huskiness was a symptom of feeling
with her, and Prescott knew it. &ldquo;They all say &lsquo;flame.&rsquo; It isn&rsquo;t
because it&rsquo;s original with you that I like it. Think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand pressed harder on her clasped hands. &ldquo;Why do you
want to remind me there are others?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;One takes
that for granted with a&mdash;flame, you know. It&rsquo;s been some
time, darling, though, since there were others for me. Perhaps
I&rsquo;d better look around. If there were a little competition
you might be nicer. How about Ariel Clare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne threw off his hand, sat bolt upright and cried &ldquo;Ariel
Clare! Good Heavens! I&rsquo;d forgotten all about the creature.
Hugh was bringing her out after lunch. Where&rsquo;s she now, do
you s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard your mother telling some one on the telephone,
I think, that the <i>Bermuda</i> was several hours late. But I wonder
whether she&rsquo;ll have any&mdash;flaming qualities!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows anything about that in this household, except
Hugh, and he&rsquo;s been persistently uncommunicative ever
since Mother hit the ceiling the morning he informed us that
such a person was about to descend upon us to be a second
daughter of the house for an indefinite period. Mother came
down&mdash;from the ceiling, you know&mdash;almost at once, but she&rsquo;d
said enough to shut Hugh&rsquo;s mouth. He merely says we&rsquo;ll see
for ourselves when Ariel gets here what she&rsquo;s like. But he&rsquo;s
justified in his high-handedness. It&rsquo;s he who runs the house&mdash;his
money, I mean. So if he wants to have a guest, he&rsquo;s a
perfect right. Any kind of a guest, even the awfullest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she may be all right. Why not? I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The click of a lamp being turned on startled them. Mrs.
Weyman, home from her Shakespeare Club meeting in Tarrytown,
had come into the room unnoticed. Enderly sprang to
his feet and in a second was slipping his hostess&rsquo; coat from her
shoulders, taking her gloves. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo; he said
needlessly and added, &ldquo;We were discussing the expected guest.
Anne and I are wondering what she&rsquo;ll be like.&rdquo; He carried the
coat, hat and gloves swiftly out to the hall, deposited them in
good order there on a chair, and came back. Mrs. Weyman
had sat down beside her daughter and was leaning forward,
holding chilled hands to the blaze, rubbing them slightly.
They were long, essentially aristocratic hands, Enderly noted,
like Anne&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman glanced up. &ldquo;Hugh has invited her to visit
us because of his friendship for her father,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;She
was only a little girl when he knew her. We shall have to wait
to see what she is like now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clare was an artist, wasn&rsquo;t he? Didn&rsquo;t Glenn tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called himself one. But no one has ever heard of him. Or
have you, perhaps?&rdquo; There was a sudden access of hope in Mrs.
Weyman&rsquo;s modulated voice.</p>
<p>But Enderly shook his head. &ldquo;Not I. But that doesn&rsquo;t signify.
What I don&rsquo;t know about art&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman stopped him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have at least heard the
name. No. Hugh&rsquo;s the only one who ever did hear about this
particular artist, I suspect. But they were great friends. And
it&rsquo;s that that matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But I didn&rsquo;t realize that Hugh cared so much
about art, that he was interested&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Anne laughed, a laugh throaty and hesitant as her speaking
voice. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she exclaimed, snatching Enderly&rsquo;s attention
from her mother. &ldquo;Joan Nevin squashed all that promptly on
its first appearance. You see, Joan does know a thing or two
about art, and artists too. They swarm at her house, Holly,
and she&rsquo;s a patroness of exhibitions and a godmother in general
to the aspiring. She knows all the big painters, the important
fellows, here and abroad, and she has a collection of her own
that&rsquo;s A1,&mdash;but you know all about her, of course. Hugh&rsquo;s
always been in love with her. His devotion is almost as famous
as her private collection. So when, all on his own, he discovered
this artist in Bermuda, he proudly bought and lugged
home one of his paintings to her. But she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman touched her daughter&rsquo;s arm warningly. This
was an Anne who distressed and embarrassed her. But Enderly,
for the minute too genuinely interested to be tactful,
said, &ldquo;Oh! So Mrs. Nevin has a painting by this unheard-of
artist. I&rsquo;d like to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Nevin hasn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman corrected him,
her fingers by now firmly pressing Anne&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how Anne knows that Hugh even intended it as a present
for her. He never said so. He merely got her over here to see
it, as I remember, and she wasn&rsquo;t very much impressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; Enderly was looking about as though actually
expecting to find the picture on one of the library walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the attic. Hugh lost no time in stowing it way after Joan
had laughed at it. He knew that she knew, you see. But Hugh
is loyal to his friends. He doesn&rsquo;t count the cost of friendship.
And Ariel Clare may be charming, no matter how much a
failure her father was as an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman got up, snapped on another light or two and
started out to dress for dinner. But Enderly, clinging to his
tactlessness, detained her by inquiring, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d she go to
school? Do you know? England?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman turned in the doorway to answer but Anne,
released from the restraining pressure of the maternal fingers,
got ahead of her with: &ldquo;We have no evidence of any education
whatever having happened to Ariel. It&rsquo;s one thing Hugh
doesn&rsquo;t try to claim. What she&rsquo;s really been doing all these
years is being a model&mdash;her father&rsquo;s model, of course&mdash;and
that may have taken all her time, poor thing. Hugh tells us
that he never painted a picture without putting her in. Where
most artists put their signature he put his daughter, do you
see. Not the subject of the picture, just a sort of afterthought,
off at the side, or in the air or in the water,&mdash;a kind of sprite
or accompanying angel. Sweet idea. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman interposed. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go on embroidering,
Anne. It&rsquo;s time to dress for dinner, and Ariel is to be our guest.
I mean to remember that, and you must, too. By the way,
Joan&rsquo;s back. Came on the <i>Bermuda</i> to-day, with Ariel Clare,
but didn&rsquo;t notice any one she thought would be she. I saw
Holly lighted up and stopped in to say &lsquo;Hello.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s coming
over after dinner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; Anne cried, persisting in clashing with
her mother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been gone so long Hugh&rsquo;s almost begun
to take an interest in other things. And here she&rsquo;s back to
spoil it all. Why can&rsquo;t she leave him alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enderly followed Mrs. Weyman into the hall. &ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;ve
been palpitating to meet your Mrs. Joan Nevin for a long
while,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;In New York every one has promised
it. Party after party they are almost sure of her, and then, for
some reason or other, she isn&rsquo;t there. I shall think myself in
luck to-night, if she actually does come here, and isn&rsquo;t, as I&rsquo;d
begun to suspect, a lady of fable merely,&mdash;an intriguing legend.
Wild Acres is really a delicious place to visit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Enderly was working into Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s hands at last.
She paused, turned back to him, and replied, &ldquo;So nice of you
to think so. And Mrs. Nevin is very worth meeting, of course.
But one forgets her fame as a collector and all that. At least,
I do. To me she&rsquo;s just a very dear girl whom I&rsquo;ve known
practically all her life. A lovely person. She&rsquo;s been away most
of the winter, and I&rsquo;ve missed her. All of us have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne, already at the foot of the stairs, put in, &ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;d be
willing to miss her permanently, for Hugh&rsquo;s sake. But come
along, Mum. Let&rsquo;s not be caught downstairs by Hugh and his
incuba. Better to take her first along with dinner. Food may
sustain us over the first shocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up too, and write a paragraph, perhaps,&rdquo; Enderly
said, behind Mrs. Weyman and her daughter on the stairs.
&ldquo;My publishers are tiresomely inconsiderate, keeping at me
about the new book. They&rsquo;re following me even here with urgent
telegrams. They don&rsquo;t hope for miracles&mdash;they expect
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the lamp in your room right for writing, and is it warm
enough there?&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman asked, her hand on the knob
of her bedroom door. Genuine concern for his comfort was
mingled with the satisfaction in her mind that Glenn had such
a worth-while friend at college and had succeeded in bringing
him home for the holidays.</p>
<p>Enderly assured his hostess of the complete comfort of her
arrangements for him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve laid a very handsome fire for
me ready to light. I&rsquo;ll start it now and be most particularly
luxurious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bedroom doors were closed, and quiet reigned
upstairs and down in the big, rambling house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span></h2>
<p>Hugh and Ariel, arriving, were met by the stillness.
Hugh passed Ariel and looked in at the library. He surveyed
the unoccupied room with some disconcertion. He hadn&rsquo;t
asked his mother to be on hand to greet Ariel, and Anne was
probably off somewhere with Glenn and Prescott Enderly.
There was no actual cause for complaint, but he was concerned
for the impression the absence of welcome might make on the
girl standing there at his back, pale and wordless under the
brilliant impersonal light of the hall chandeliers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s probably dressing for dinner.&rdquo; He spoke with
assumed assurance and liveliness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you your room. I&rsquo;m
pretty sure I know which &rsquo;tis. And Anne will come straight
there the minute she gets in. She&rsquo;s off somewhere skylarking,
or&mdash;&rdquo; he looked at his watch and amended, &ldquo;probably dressing
for dinner too. I&rsquo;ll look her up in her room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>He went ahead, carrying the suitcases up the stairs. As he
passed his mother&rsquo;s and Anne&rsquo;s doors he said something more,
it didn&rsquo;t matter what, in the hope that one of the doors would
open and some one appear to make Ariel feel at home. But
nothing so fortuitous happened. His resentment became actual
when he had to feel for the electric-light switch in the guest
room allotted to Ariel and was conscious that she had followed
him in and was standing there in the dark as aware of the
chill in the room as was he. They might at least have told
Rose, the second maid, to have the lights turned on, and a fire
blazing in the little marble fireplace. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go and hunt up
my kid sister,&rdquo; he promised, when he had found the switch.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be along right away to help you unpack and settle.
Dinner&rsquo;s very soon. You mustn&rsquo;t dress for it unless you want
to particularly. All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel assured him that she was all right. And then, when
the door closed on his back she breathed one deep breath of
satisfaction. It was good to be alone, and to have, if only for
a few minutes, a reprieve from the ultimately unavoidable
meeting with Hugh&rsquo;s family. It seemed days and days ago, not
a mere few hours, since Hugh had taken her arm and hurried
her through the jam of people and luggage surging under
the great swinging letter C in the customs shed.</p>
<p>As they had stood with the customs official whom Hugh had
captured with what had every appearance of special secret
powers&mdash;since although Ariel was almost the last person off
the <i>Bermuda</i>, she was certainly the very first person to have
her baggage passed on&mdash;Hugh had turned and looked down
at her with his first concentrated attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you warm?&rdquo; he had asked almost sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. It&rsquo;s very col&mdash;d in the States,&rdquo; she shivered
out, taken unaware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But you keep out the cold, you know, with warm
clothes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look at all warmly enough
dressed. Is there another coat, a big overcoat, anywhere in your
baggage? We&rsquo;ll get it out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Ariel told him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize how cold
it would be the beginning of March. I thought March was almost
spring here. I was stupid.&rdquo; She shivered again,&mdash;not
with cold this time, but from sheer nervousness at the intent
way Hugh was looking down at what she guessed were her
blue lips and pinched nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re driving out to Wild
Acres, after a good hot tea, in my open roadster. That means a
fur coat for you if we can pick one up along the way to the
&lsquo;Carnation.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the tearoom. You&rsquo;ll need a fur coat in this
climate, anyway, and you might as well get it to-day as to-morrow.
I ought to have borrowed Anne&rsquo;s. <i>My</i> stupidity.
They&rsquo;re expecting me to bring a live, real girl home this evening,
you know, not an imported icicle. An icicle from Bermuda
would be too surprising!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ariel did not laugh. The tone of his humor surprised
and confused her. Sometimes thus she had heard adults banter
a child. But she wasn&rsquo;t a child, and even if she had been,
would have been put off by such banter. Children are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is almost spring,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;d better get a coat now. I&rsquo;d rather buy a spring coat, you
see, a little later. It would be more&mdash;practical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh, however, proved domineering. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t your affair,
it&rsquo;s mine, since I neglected to bring something warm for
you. Besides, I&rsquo;d rather, much, buy a pretty fur coat for you
this afternoon than a handsome coffin for you day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel said nothing farther. That word &ldquo;coffin&rdquo; which Hugh
had uttered so lightly had shut her throat tight like fingers
around it. Three weeks ago she had watched a coffin lowered
into the ground.... So she went with Hugh dumbly, numbed
by the noise and the crowds of the city as much as by the unaccustomed
cold, a walk of several blocks to the place where
his roadster stood parked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut out to Fifth Avenue,&rdquo; he told her, opening the
car door, &ldquo;cruise down it until we see a fur sale in some window
or other, bundle you up in the best-looking one, and be
at the &lsquo;Carnation&rsquo; in time for four o&rsquo;clock tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seat of the roadster was swung so low and the wind-shield
stood so high that Ariel felt protected from both wind
and hurrying crowds the minute she was in. Hugh did not
speak again while he picked his way out through jostling traffic
over bumpy pavements to Ariel&rsquo;s first sight and experience
of Fifth Avenue. She sensed that Hugh&rsquo;s silence had nothing
to do with the difficulties of driving. Glancing up at his profile,
she felt that he had forgotten her, and that his skillful
maneuvering of the car was automatic. He was deep in
thoughts of his own, in his own inner life.</p>
<p>But as they turned into the Avenue he came out of his abstraction
to say, &ldquo;Watch out for fur coats now, will you, and
shout the first window you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one there, across the street, a whole window of
fur coats,&rdquo; Ariel told him.</p>
<p>He parked as soon as he could find a place. And when he
came around the car to open the door on Ariel&rsquo;s side he stood
a moment, aware of her again as he had been in the customs
shed. He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be fun picking out this coat for a
welcoming present.&rdquo; He smiled to himself, for he had resisted
the pun &ldquo;a warm welcome.&rdquo; He had noticed that she did not
like that sort of fun when he had tried to be humorous before,
and went on seriously, &ldquo;It will be very sweet of you, Ariel, if
you let me please myself about this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Ariel knew in that instant how utterly he was changed.
That first sight of him from the deck had been strangely deceiving.
She was sorry for him, without knowing why. Of
course he should please himself about buying a fur coat for
her. She wanted him to be pleased and happy, as he had been
all those days in Bermuda.</p>
<p>Inside the shop door Hugh paused and stood looking about,
while salesmen and salesgirls hovered, watching him with
eager curiosity. Then, when he had come to his decision,
he swooped, a clean swoop, seizing on the proprietor of the
shop&mdash;how he guessed he was the proprietor and would
so save time and words for them, Ariel did not know&mdash;and
pointed out a soft white coat, hanging at the end of a near
rack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; he said, with a quick nod. &ldquo;Will you
please try this on the lady? Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant Ariel was turning herself about at the center
of a fan of long mirrors, in the beautiful coat. Its collar rolled
away softly at her neck, its girlishness offsetting the luxuriousness.
The garment was cut straight from shoulder to hem, and
its cuffs, narrow and young, like the collar, rolled softly back
at the wrists. It was flexible and light. It was like being wrapped
in swansdown, not fur. Then Hugh stood behind her and
folded it back for her to take in the scarlet silk lining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; he asked, meeting her eyes in the mirror.
It was plain, in the mirror, that already the new coat was giving
him pleasure, just as he had promised her it would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I like it! I love it,&rdquo; she cried, poising on her toes,
almost as tall as Hugh now, smiling at his reflected eyes,
feeling as if the coat were wings folded down her body from
her shoulders,&mdash;soft, lovely wings, making her tall, light,
swift. But then suddenly she forgot the coat, forgot her pleasure
and Hugh&rsquo;s pleasure. She turned on Hugh Weyman and
threw her head back, meeting his eyes squarely. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d much
rather have had the violets. Much, much rather!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He could not think what she meant at first. Then he remembered.
Joan Nevin had held out her hands for the violets, and
he had tossed them up to her. But they were really Ariel&rsquo;s violets.
He had taken them to the boat for her. <i>They</i> were to
have been his welcoming present. He slowly flushed.</p>
<p>Ariel was sorry and dropped her eyes. After a second Hugh
said, &ldquo;My dear girl, in a few weeks the woods at Wild Acres
will be purple with violets, banks and banks of them. Yellow
violets too, and white. You shall have your heart&rsquo;s full. I
promise. But this is rather nice just now. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was teasing her. But he was as sincere as was she. She
jammed her hands into the deep, soft pockets, while her fingers
clenched. She had made a fool of herself. But she didn&rsquo;t
mind much. He was sweet, and dear, this Hugh she had never
known.</p>
<p>Then he moved a little away with the shopman. Ariel surmised
that the price of the coat was now under discussion. The
little Jew rubbed his hands, hesitated, smiled up almost affectionately,
and named it. Ariel did not hear his words, but
she saw Hugh come very near to starting, while his shoulders
stiffened. So it was some outrageous price, and Hugh was surprised
and would not think of paying it. But he ought to have
known he was picking out the most expensive thing in the
shop. It was obviously a coat for a princess, a Russian princess
in old Petersburg when the world was kind to princesses.
This scarlet lining!... The deftly rolling, beautiful collar
and cuffs! Hugh said something then, and the shopkeeper
raised his voice in replying. &ldquo;But it is a most wonderful bargain.
Wonderful! And I named you my bottom price on account
of the season. I saw at once that you would buy or leave
a thing. So I did not bother to bargain by naming a price of
unreasonableness. If you do not care for the coat enough&mdash;I
am sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The little man was vigorously shrugging his sincerity and
his sorrow. For an instant more Ariel saw Hugh hesitate.
Then his eyes narrowed ever so slightly and he too shrugged&mdash;a
whimsical submission.</p>
<p>He came toward Ariel. &ldquo;Better keep it on,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll carry the tweed one. Excuse me a minute, please, while
I go to the office and establish my credit over their telephone.&rdquo;
He placed a chair for her with as much manner as if she
were indeed the princess the coat made her out to be, and
went down the shop where there was a glass-encased office
booth.</p>
<p>First Hugh spoke into the telephone, then the bookkeeper,
and finally the shopkeeper himself. Ariel watched all that went
on behind the glass with interest but without hearing a word.
It took only a very few minutes for Hugh to prove his financial
soundness and then he was back with her. At the door
which he was holding obsequiously and happily open for them,
the shopkeeper murmured, &ldquo;If madam would like a hat, my
brother next door has some marvelous Parisian models. The
finest in New York. There is an artist there who makes them
to one&rsquo;s head, while one waits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hugh shook his head, smiling at the &ldquo;madam.&rdquo; Did
the man think this young girl was his wife?</p>
<p>In the car, on their way to the &ldquo;Carnation,&rdquo; Ariel said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid, Mr. Weyman, this cost a great deal. More than it ought.
I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He had forgotten already about the coat. &ldquo;Oh!
Why, yes, more than I had expected, but I don&rsquo;t believe more
than it&rsquo;s worth. The only difficulty was that I thought I had
enough with me, but I hadn&rsquo;t, and so it meant bothering the
people at my office. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. And now, Ariel,
I can begin to enjoy your company, without worry.&rdquo; At the
end of another half block he added, &ldquo;And you will call me
Hugh, please, or I shall have to Miss-Clare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not yet four o&rsquo;clock when they got to the &ldquo;Carnation,&rdquo;
so they had the place almost to themselves. Ariel poured out
the tea from a chubby carnation-painted pot, and felt, almost,
that it was five years ago and she was offering the studio&rsquo;s
hospitality to a hawklike, rather silent new friend of her
father&rsquo;s. But she had only to look across the little table at him
to remember that it was not so,&mdash;to see that all was different,
really. She was noticing how Hugh&rsquo;s vigorous, close-cropped
hair, which had been black in Bermuda, was now hoar-frosted
at temples and ears. It startled her and made her shy again.
This premature grayness, taken together with an austere tightening
of the corners of his lips, and two deep lines rising from
them, frightened Ariel a little. She felt breathless, almost awe-struck.
So much must have happened to a person to change
him like that! Where she had counted on finding her father&rsquo;s
friend, to-day she had not found him. Everything had been,
from the minute of their meeting on the pier, just between
this man and herself alone, as it had used to be between him
and her father. Was her father, she wondered, hovering on the
edge of her present contact with Hugh as she had hovered on
the edge of theirs five years ago? This was too poignant an
idea, and she shut it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Hugh was smiling at her across the bouquet of carnations
which decorated the center of their table. He was exclaiming:
&ldquo;Imagine Mr. Schimpler suggesting a new hat for you from
his brother&rsquo;s shop, with a hat like that to flaunt in his face!
It&rsquo;s a real hat, Ariel, but I suppose you know it. And the
feather! There are no words for the feather! It has an insistent
personality all its own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel lifted her fingers searchingly, up to find the feather.
She started to say, &ldquo;Father found&mdash;&rdquo; and got no farther than
opened lips. But she tried her best to smile. He must be the
one first to name her father. The next piece of toast that she
swallowed, forcing herself, tasted salt.</p>
<p class="tb">Wild Acres, the Weymans&rsquo; estate, is on the Hudson near
Tarrytown&mdash;a drive, from Forty-Second Street and the &ldquo;Carnation&rdquo;
tearoom, of something over an hour and a half. Ariel,
snuggled back in her coat for a princess against the cushions
of the roadster&rsquo;s low seat, observed alternately the flying white
landscape and Hugh&rsquo;s intent profile. How he dared push the
car along like this over the icy, snowy road she did not know,
but since he did dare she had not even a quiver of doubt of
their safety, for all her instinct shouted confidence in the judgment
of this stranger with the incised lines at the corners of
his mouth. He might not be her father&rsquo;s friend, have long
forgotten that, and there had not yet been time for him to become
hers, but he was a person&mdash;of this she was calmly aware&mdash;to
trust one&rsquo;s life to.</p>
<p>They had sailed along for miles before he spoke at all.
Then he asked, &ldquo;Were you ever in an automobile before,
Ariel? They aren&rsquo;t allowed in Bermuda yet, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Only government trucks. There are a few of those.
But in France, of course, Fa&mdash;we taxied quite a lot, just for
the fun of it. That was our&mdash;my first motoring. This is the
first time I&rsquo;ve seen snow, though. But I don&rsquo;t feel that it is.
I&rsquo;ve imagined it so concretely, I suppose, and then it&rsquo;s in so
many books, of course. If I picked up a handful now, or began
walking in it, the sensation wouldn&rsquo;t be a new sensation,&mdash;because
of imagination. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know. It was like that when I went West years ago
with my father,&rdquo; Hugh responded, with sympathetic understanding.
&ldquo;The prairie we found there was no more real than
the prairie I&rsquo;d lived on and played over with the gang in
Tarrytown the year I was ten, though we&rsquo;d made that prairie
for ourselves out of reading and imagination. The very earth
had the same feel beneath my feet that it had had under my
moccasined feet when I was &lsquo;Wild Eagle,&rsquo; bravest of chiefs.
The moccasins were imagined too, although the headdress was
real. There&rsquo;s something of a thrill in catching up with these
places in our imagination, isn&rsquo;t there? By the way, have you
got it straight in your mind, Ariel, about us Weymans, how
many and who we all are at Wild Acres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. There&rsquo;s your mother. And your sister and
brother. Doctor Hazzard said that your sister and brother
would be at home for the Easter vacation now. But, of course,
I don&rsquo;t know them with my imagination the way you knew
the prairie and I knew the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>They both laughed. He said, &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t give you a whole
literary and imaginative background for our household. But
you&rsquo;ve left out the first and most interesting member. Perhaps
I didn&rsquo;t mention her in my letter to Doctor Hazzard. It&rsquo;s my
Grandmother Weyman. She lives above us, literally as well as
figuratively, in the attic which she had fixed over into an exclusive
apartment for herself when she returned from her last
winter in Egypt, several years ago. You may or you may not
get to know her really. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll hardly ever see her.
She&rsquo;s rather disconcertingly invisible and exclusive. I mean,
she&rsquo;s exclusive even toward us, the family. Her contacts are
with Silence and the Angels,&mdash;that kind of exclusiveness.
She&rsquo;s got it down to a science, how to be alone when she wants
to be alone. You may think her&mdash;odd. People do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was catching a rich, almost secret note of tenderness
in Hugh&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;He adores his grandmother,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;And he doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s odd. He thinks she&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after Grandam, there&rsquo;s my mother, of course. She&rsquo;s
perfectly visible, from all sides. And she&rsquo;ll help you a lot,
Ariel, in the&mdash;in the adjustments to a new life you&rsquo;re in for
now, I&rsquo;m afraid. She&rsquo;s just the sort of person to do that,&mdash;practical,
sensible. Then there&rsquo;s my kid sister Anne. Only she
won&rsquo;t seem kid-sisterish to you. She&rsquo;s a month or two older
than you are, in fact, and you may get to be great friends. Doctor
Hazzard wrote that that was something you&rsquo;d missed so far,
contemporaries. She is a sophomore at Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glenn&rsquo;s the student of the family. Got it from Grandfather
Weyman, perhaps. He&rsquo;s older than Anne&mdash;a year&mdash;and a
junior at Yale. But he seems younger, you&rsquo;ll see, in spite of
reading Spengler and writing Greek sonnets that have made
quite a stir&mdash;in the heart of a Greek professor or two, the
only people who can read &rsquo;em. He&rsquo;ll probably be rude to you.
But you mustn&rsquo;t mind him. He&rsquo;s rude to us all just now. He&rsquo;s
got an idea that rudeness has some sort of affinity with intelligence.
He drops the pose only for his friend, Prescott Enderly.
Ever heard of him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Ariel hadn&rsquo;t. So Hugh explained about the young man&rsquo;s
fame and that he was to be Ariel&rsquo;s fellow-guest for the present
at Wild Acres. &ldquo;When college opens again, there&rsquo;ll be just
you and mother and I at Wild Acres, unless you count
Grandam, my grandmother, which you probably won&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re
not going to make it before dark, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; The time had
come to switch on the headlights. Gray, cobwebby dusk was
settling over the snowy world.</p>
<p>Ariel, comforted by Hugh&rsquo;s friendly explanations, warm and
at home in her fur coat, was relaxed and confident at last. She
asked, &ldquo;And those children, Nicky and Persis? They aren&rsquo;t
related? &lsquo;Uncle&rsquo; was only a manner of speaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car picked up speed appallingly and Ariel&rsquo;s confidence
in Hugh as a safe keeper for any life was shattered. The
road was icy under the snow and he was not slowing even for
the curves. But when he answered her, his words came evenly
and a little drawled, a strange tempo to speak in when one is
driving at fifty miles an hour on a precarious winter road. &ldquo;Yes.
If they called me &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; that <i>was</i> only a manner of speaking.
Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s manner of speaking. Most of her men friends are
&lsquo;uncle&rsquo; to the children. Did you gather exactly who <i>she</i> was,
on the ship, Ariel? Her husband was Nevin, the producer,&mdash;&lsquo;dramaturg,&rsquo;
he called himself. Your father would have known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was really a dangerous speed. Never had she realized that
bodies could move so fast through space. Her breath came almost
in a sob. It was only after a mile or more of this agony
that Hugh became aware of her fear, but he slowed down then
at once. &ldquo;Do excuse me,&rdquo; he muttered contritely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
right. It isn&rsquo;t safe. I forgot I wasn&rsquo;t alone. An idiocy I won&rsquo;t
repeat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that I&rsquo;m not used&mdash;&rdquo; Ariel murmured. Her knees
began to tremble, now that she had no cause for fear and the
danger was past. She hoped he would not feel how she was
shaking from head to feet, as with a chill. If he did, he said
nothing about it but asked, &ldquo;Was Mrs. Nevin entertaining?
Did you enjoy her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entertaining?&rdquo; Ariel sounded amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. She can be, you know. She&rsquo;s rather famous for
wit and charm and brilliance. Didn&rsquo;t you guess that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t. We never even spoke to each other, you
see. I happened to have a chair beside hers on deck, but we
didn&rsquo;t speak. Even the children didn&rsquo;t. They just happened to
stand by me while we were docking. That was the way it was.
Perhaps she&rsquo;s like your grandmother&mdash;Mrs. Nevin. Keeps her
company with silence and the angels....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Hers is another sort of exclusiveness altogether,&rdquo; Hugh
answered. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t imagine two days, and not a word....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was Aldous Huxley. I think that was the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose he might have more for her at this stage
in her life than you, Ariel.&rdquo; His tone was dry. The lines at
the corners of his mouth deepened. But it was too dark for
Ariel to see that now. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; he said
suddenly. &ldquo;All lighted up. So she&rsquo;s at home before us. Ours is
the next place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel saw a great house, as magnificent as Government
House, crowning a low hill above them with dozens of windows
blazing through the dusk. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Holly. Her husband,
Nevin, built it. It&rsquo;s palatial, isn&rsquo;t it! Wild Acres is much humbler.
You&rsquo;ll see in a minute. Or rather in a few minutes, because
there&rsquo;s a long, very twisty avenue up to our portico
and you don&rsquo;t really know there&rsquo;s a house until you practically
come, bump, into the front door. Here&rsquo;s the entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car had turned in through a dark, rather low, stone
archway, and the headlights were cutting a golden shaft up
through snow-enchanted, stilly woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span></h2>
<p>Ariel was in no hurry for Anne to come. She pulled
the shades at the two windows, shutting out the dark-white
woods whose tree boughs came right up against the panes.
Then she slipped out of her coat and dropped it on the white
counterpane of the bed, scarlet lining upwards. The room was
not warm, for here on the second floor, and more particularly
in the wing where the guest rooms were situated, one needed
a fire in the grate in winter weather. But Ariel had come too
freshly in from the cold air in her face, and was too recently
out of the warmth of the fur coat, to mind the cold yet. She
threw herself on the bed beside the coat and lifting one soft
sleeve rubbed it against her face. Silly girl! Her eyelashes were
soaked with tears. The fur grew slowly wet, against her face.</p>
<p>An odd clumsy noise was coming down the hall outside
her door. Some one walking on stilts? Ariel sprang up from
the bed in time for the knock on the door. The sight of the
girl who answered Ariel&rsquo;s invitation to enter was more startling
than the sound had been. It was Anne, wrapped in a black
silk kimono embossed from shoulder to hem in huge geometrical
figures gone wrong in color and form,&mdash;a witch&rsquo;s
dream of color and design. Her legs were bare, and it was
the high heels of the mules slipped onto her bare feet&mdash;green
mules decorated with inordinate purple puffs of feather&mdash;which
had made the stilt-walking noises in the hall and still
made them in the room. Ariel, who had been promised a meeting
with Hugh&rsquo;s sister, was taken aback and left wordless at
this meeting with a kimono and mules instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>It was hard to believe that Anne was real, a girl, and not a
doll, walking. Ariel remembered the hateful dolls which had
for some time now been an offense to her sensibilities and her
father&rsquo;s in gift-shop windows in Hamilton and St. George&rsquo;s.
This girl brought them vividly to mind: dangling yard-long
legs that could be tied in knots after they were crossed at the
knees, black hair parted in a seam down the exact middle
of the head and whirled into tight sleek buttons over the ears,
crazy outstanding wirelike eyelashes, dead-white cheeks, magenta
mouths warped by the paint brush into an eternal leer.
But from these horrid images you were shielded by the glass
of shop windows. Never had Ariel dreamed that she would
become involved with a living one.</p>
<p>The magenta lips opened. Words fell out. &ldquo;Well, hello,
Ariel Clare. Were you seasick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep throaty voice with the catch in it only heightened
the doll effect.</p>
<p>Ariel shook her head negatively, and stepping backward,
crouched down on the side of the bed as Anne clumped a
step or two nearer. &ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; the magenta lips husked
on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time for the dinner gong. Where&rsquo;s your bag?
Oh, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mules clumpety-clumped to the suitcases which Hugh
had unstrapped for Ariel before he left her, and throwing
back their covers Anne began tossing the things inside about as
roughly as the inspector on the pier had done. &ldquo;Dinner dress?&rdquo;
she inquired. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just time to change.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;There it is. The green!&rdquo; Ariel spoke hurriedly, to stop the
useless mauling of her delicate possessions.</p>
<p>Anne jerked out the green frock. &ldquo;Rather nice,&rdquo; she approved.
&ldquo;Clever.&rdquo; As she tossed it to Ariel she caught sight of
the coat. &ldquo;My word! But you are a gorgeous baby&mdash;! What a
duck, what a <i>lamb</i> of a coat! You lucky, lucky girl!&rdquo; She
snatched it up from the bed and held it ecstatically before her
person, and turned to look at it in the mirror of the door. Ariel
did not know what to do. She wanted to tell Anne that it was
a gift from her brother. But she couldn&rsquo;t. For suddenly, and
for the first time, the gift rather troubled her. It was too much.
Hugh should never have done it.</p>
<p>While Ariel hesitated, Anne had dropped the coat and turned
to sit in front of Ariel&rsquo;s dressing table. Delicately, with the
tips of first the jewel-nailed little finger of one hand, then the
other, she began to work at the contours of her painted lips,
pointing up the cynical expression. The color was so recently
applied that it was still malleable. As she worked at this
delicate bit of art she talked, a steady flow of words, but
thrown out all in that halting, throaty manner that made it
seem not so much real speech from a real person as goblin
talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy you, Ariel, being thrown into the middle of
our dinner table for the first time to-night. No wonder Hugh&rsquo;s
worried you&rsquo;ll feel &lsquo;strange.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s been in my room, begging
me tearfully to make you feel cozy. I love to please Hugh. It&rsquo;s
so easy&mdash;like tickling a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Ariel was slipping the green frock over her head. Anne
whirled suddenly around on her and two brown eyes, for the
moment open and even na&iuml;ve in their expression, looked her
over. What they saw was a thin face with rather narrow, rather
light eyes and coral-faint lips just then emerging from the
green cloud of the dinner frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mermaid,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;You look just like one.
What do I look like? Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say.&rdquo; But, Ariel, looking
into the friendly face, had already forgotten the ugly
dolls.</p>
<p>Far away, deep at the heart of the house, three musical
notes sounded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dinner gong. And we&rsquo;re both of
us late. You must think it up and tell me later, what I look
like. Appease my mummy. That&rsquo;s a duck. She hates unpunctuality.
Tell her we got so interested in each other we forgot the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was gone. Ariel stooped and found her own reflection
in the mirror. She pushed at her hair with shaking fingers.
No time now to look for her brush in the chaos that Anne had
made of the suitcases. She was glad Anne had liked the frock.
Of course it was lovely, for her father had planned it. It
was his creation, like his pictures.</p>
<p class="tb">She was standing in the library door, aware of every one
at once and of no one in particular, until a sudden hush fell
as they became conscious of her. Mrs. Weyman&mdash;it must
be she&mdash;came forward down the room and took Ariel&rsquo;s hands
in hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am Hugh&rsquo;s mother. But where&rsquo;s
Anne? Hugh said she was taking care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel explained about Anne while she was being led forward
toward the group around the fire. Mrs. Weyman was a
surprise to Ariel. How could any one so young and slight
be Hugh&rsquo;s mother? She looked like a girl, a very dignified, socially
competent girl, but so young! It was not from her that
Hugh and Anne got their soft dark coloring and their clear-cut
features. She was blond, small, and pretty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Glenn,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman introduced her younger son,
who tossed a cigarette into the fire and took Ariel&rsquo;s hand.
He was a long-legged boy, with a mop of tousled black hair,
clever eyes, and an ambiguous, crooked smile. Very white
teeth. His tie, a brilliant orange ribbon, and his teeth wavered
before Ariel&rsquo;s shaky vision, and then she was turned to
face Prescott Enderly.</p>
<p>The young celebrity was quickly effervescent. In the instant
of introduction he gave everything to Ariel Clare, all the color
and sparkle of his personality. He had liked the back of her
green frock and the way her hair&mdash;pale hair, of no color at
all by lamplight&mdash;curled in at the back of her neck, before
she was turned to him. But the thin cheeks and the narrow
eyes were a disappointment. Even more of a disappointment
was the sense that this girl, even in the instant of being introduced
to himself, was looking past him as if in search of something
of more interest. He was correct; she was looking for
&ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; and confidently expecting to find it here on these
walls. She was looking for it with her heart in her eyes. No
wonder she disappointed the eager artistic soul of the young
man from whom she had turned away before his glance released
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noon&rdquo; was not there. No white sunlight shattered the somber
spaces of the paneled walls. There were only black-and-white
etchings, and over the fireplace a portrait of some ancient
Weyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only waiting for Anne now,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman murmured.
&ldquo;And here she is. Grandam&rsquo;s not coming down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Anne had exchanged her kimono for a black velvet, very
tight frock, relieved by a string of scarlet beads, dangling scarlet
earrings, and high-heeled red pumps. They went now, informally,
down the hall to the dining room.</p>
<p>The pictures in the dining room appeared to be <i>all</i> family
portraits, some of them earlier than the Revolution. But Ariel
was neither disappointed nor surprised not to find &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;
here. For she had come to the conclusion by this time that it
was hung in the drawing-room which she had glimpsed across
the hall from the library, as they came out. That, after all,
would be the appropriate place for it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman took the head of the table, Hugh the foot.
The places were laid rather far apart on the glimmering white
damask, and the one little maid who flitted, a white-and-black
moth, in velvety silence from shoulder to shoulder and
back and forth through the ghostly, swinging pantry door,
never seemed to come to rest.</p>
<p>Ariel had a talent: the gift of a graceful, even a gracious
silence. And this night she sat during the long dinner hour at
the board of strangers, scarcely uttering a word, and yet not
seeming bored, and certainly not boring. The talk seemed to
flow over her, around her, even through her, while her silence
bent with it but did not dissolve&mdash;like forget-me-nots in a
brook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>So thought Glenn, who, sitting next to her, was almost as
silent as herself, but with the thick silence of moodiness and
self-centeredness. To-night, however, he was a little less self-centered
than usual, for he was giving thought to Ariel. And
even when his mind turned to something far away and long
ago, Ariel had impelled it in that direction. He was remembering
when he was a little boy, ten&mdash;or was it nine?&mdash;years
old. His mother was abroad with his father, vacationing, and
Grandam had returned to oversee things at Wild Acres. He,
the boy Glenn, had taken the occasion to come down with
scarlet fever. Grandam straightway moved her things into
Hugh&rsquo;s room, which opened out of Glenn&rsquo;s, and Hugh&rsquo;s
things away somewhere into one of the spare rooms. Then had
followed magic,&mdash;long days of it. Forget-me-nots flowing with
a brook, under water, yet never away from their roots. But
where did forget-me-nots come in, when he was merely shut
away in two rooms with Grandam? And the crystal water running,
running? Wings in the air too? How had all this got
into those shut-away rooms and days? But they had. He remembered
them more vividly than the fever and the headache.
Yet why did he connect the two experiences,&mdash;Ariel
silent beside him at the commonplace rite of dinner at Wild
Acres, and Grandam sitting beside his bed in the night, years
and years ago? It was two silences he was connecting,&mdash;clear
silences, crystal silences, through which at any moment one
might hear the footsteps of beauty coming&mdash;coming....
Wasn&rsquo;t there a poem somewhere&mdash;?</p>
<p>Old Pres was talking. Something about Spengler&mdash;no&mdash;Walter
Lippmann. Glenn had been missing, had skipped
whole gobs of what his brilliant friend was saying. An important
contribution to civilized thinking? Walter Lippmann&rsquo;s
book? Oh, yes, Glenn agreed with that. Prescott, meeting his
glance, caught the full force of the agreement and regained in
a twinkling the complacency he had been in danger of losing
since Glenn had gone obviously wool-gathering and stopped
listening. For Glenn was the only one here really interested in
this sort of thing. The others were merely polite, pretending
agreement and interest. Prescott and Glenn understood each
other, valued each other. The others didn&rsquo;t count&mdash;except in
quite a different way. Anne counted&mdash;rather&mdash;of course. But
it was Glenn he really addressed himself to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>And Glenn was saying to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m following old
Pres now&mdash;what he&rsquo;s saying. I like this dessert, almond flavoring
it&rsquo;s got. And yet it still holds. There&rsquo;s magic here&mdash;in
this silence&mdash;something wonderful here.... Like when I
was a kid....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moth was directed to bring coffee into the drawing-room
later, for Mrs. Nevin was coming to have it with them. A fire
was blazing on the hearth there. The moth had been sent to
apply the match during dinner.</p>
<p>The drawing-room contrasted sharply with the hall, the dining
room, and the library. They were dim, big apartments,
lighted by richly shaded but subdued lamps. The drawing-room
had creamy walls, spindly gilt furniture, and turquois
blue rugs. An Italian chandelier, a cluster of glittering bulbs
and crystals, outdid the fire and the lamps and made the room
brighter than day.</p>
<p>Anne and Enderly quickly appropriated the little blue and
gilt sofa near the library door, sat uneasily there and looked
prepared, at the flick of an eye, to escape into the romantic,
shadowy library. Glenn got a book, and with the air of being
a martyr to his mother&rsquo;s desires, settled himself with it in a
distant chair, a straight-backed, fragile piece of furniture which
looked as though it had never before in its history been read
on. Hugh, his mother and Ariel were together around the low
table, a little back from the fire, which soon was to hold the
coffee things. Mrs. Weyman, in the glaring white light cast
down by the chandelier, looked more a possible mother of
Hugh than she had when Ariel first saw her, but she was still
very pretty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>There was only one picture on the creamy walls of this room.
That was a big panel framed in ebony, which reached from
ceiling to floor of the wall opposite the door from the hall,&mdash;a
conventionalized, brilliant shower of garden flowers.</p>
<p>It was beautiful, Ariel thought. <i>But where was &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;?</i>
Hugh might want it for his own room of course, but even wanting
it, he would never deny others the satisfaction of living with
it too. Ariel couldn&rsquo;t believe him so selfish. It might be loaned to
some exhibition. But surely Hugh would explain about it now,
any minute. He must know that she was wondering and longing
to see it. She remembered, however, his strange silence on
this matter of the picture in his letters to her father. Her father
had refused to ask when Hugh was silent. His pride was now
Ariel&rsquo;s. She would not violate it. And Mrs. Weyman was speaking
to her, directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh has told us really very little about you, Ariel. We&rsquo;d
hardly heard your name a month ago. I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t even
know where you lived, your family, I mean, originally. And
your mother. Have you been long without her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My family? It was my father. I&rsquo;ve always lived in Bermuda.
Father lived in Chicago. Was born there. But he went
to Bermuda and took me with him when I was only a few
weeks old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? And your mother, then?&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman prompted.
Under the brilliant glare from the chandelier, Ariel felt how
everything ultimately must come to light. Mrs. Weyman was
preparing to see Ariel&rsquo;s past history as plainly as Ariel was seeing
the big, glittering coffee machine which the maid, Rose, at
this moment, was setting up on the table among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother died,&mdash;two, three years ago. I&rsquo;m not certain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman looked her perplexity and surprise at her
son, but he offered no help. She could not catch his eye. He
merely leaned forward to adjust the alcohol burner under
the coffee urn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it was like this,&rdquo; Ariel explained after a minute
when the silence seemed to demand more of her. &ldquo;My mother
didn&rsquo;t want a baby. She wanted to marry but she didn&rsquo;t want
babies. But Father didn&rsquo;t know that. Not until I was going
to be born. They were both teachers in a school near Chicago.
And my mother wanted to go on teaching. She was the principal
of the school, in fact,&mdash;made more money than my father
and was above him, although she was so young. She cared more
about education than anything in the world. She read whole
libraries of books on education, gave lectures, and she wrote
for magazines about it all the while. It was a great bother to
have a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel hesitated and the silence closed in on her again. Hugh
was opening a cigarette case, selecting a cigarette, frowning
slightly. Mrs. Weyman was looking at Ariel, smiling, but
oddly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see how it was a great bother. She, my mother, was
so much more important than my father, had a lot more to
do really. Worked harder. And they needed the money she
could make. Besides, she loved education, and&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t
love me. But Father did. From the very first. Even from before
I was born.... He loved me....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Was she going to go down in a storm of weeping? She felt
it raging toward her, a storm of terrible weeping. It did not
threaten from her heart or from herself at all,&mdash;from the outside
somehow, an impersonal, objective storm racing toward
her. She clutched her fingers into her palms. She had never
cried before anybody in her life. And now of all times to choose
for such a performance! If Hugh would only look at her! Only
steady her! But he did not look up from his cigarette case. He
was feeling its cold silver surfaces. There was no help from him.</p>
<p>At her back Mr. Enderly was laughing. Anne had made him
laugh by something she had been murmuring. They had not
heard anything of what Ariel had said. And then Ariel heard
a book close sharply. So Glenn was listening. He was not reading.
She turned to him and went on. She did not know how but
his shutting the book had shut out the storm of weeping. Like
a door closed against a whirlwind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my mother gave me to Father. As soon as she was able
to go back to her work again, she gave me right to him. I was
five weeks old. I was all his, every bit his. Not hers any more.
I was as easy as a kitten to take care of, so tiny, so healthy. I
could fit into such small places, almost into his pocket. He took
me to Bermuda. He&rsquo;d always wanted to paint. And there, in
Bermuda, he began to paint with all his soul. But the way he
supported us was by writing Western stories for Western magazines.
He&rsquo;d already sold a few while he was still teaching. But
in Bermuda he had much more time. The stories didn&rsquo;t bring
much money. But we didn&rsquo;t mind. There was nothing we really
wanted that we didn&rsquo;t have.&mdash;Even Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was looking at Hugh now. He would understand about
Paris. But he was regarding her gravely and did not seem able
to smile his understanding of Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one has relatives. Aunts? Uncles? Grandmothers? You
and your father,&mdash;you weren&rsquo;t cut quite adrift from your
family, were you?&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman asked with sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother and Father were the end of their families. There
were no relatives to be cut adrift from.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman asked one more question. The expression of
her face and voice robbed it of impertinence. &ldquo;And the paintings?
Didn&rsquo;t that, in time, take the place of the stories for
magazines? Didn&rsquo;t they pay your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Never. He didn&rsquo;t want them to, didn&rsquo;t even think
about the possibilities until Hugh&mdash;&rdquo; But again Hugh was
frowning to himself, not coming to her aid with look or word.
And she blundered on, &ldquo;Father did have an exhibition once in
a hotel in Hamilton. But only stupid people came and nobody
bought. So he didn&rsquo;t bother with that again. He only thought
of it at all because Hugh had put it into his head. But sometimes
other artists who had come to Bermuda to paint, and one
or two artists who lived there, came to the studio and saw the
pictures. They knew how wonderful they were, of course. But
most artists are poor&mdash;nearly all artists, I guess&mdash;and if they
couldn&rsquo;t sell their own pictures, how could they buy Father&rsquo;s?
They couldn&rsquo;t, of course. But Father was of immense help to
them. Because his work was original and he gave them ideas.
Showed them their mistakes. Some of them were really quite
talented. But Father was different. Father is&mdash;was&mdash;<i>is</i> a genius....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was looking surprised at something. At what
Ariel had said last, perhaps. So Ariel added, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have
to tell you about that. There&rsquo;s &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo; you see, to prove Father&rsquo;s
genius. Father thought it was the best thing he ever did. Many
of his other pictures were important, he knew, very important.
But &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo; Hugh&rsquo;s picture, is the best. It satisfied him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman, not she, had brought up the subject of her
father&rsquo;s paintings. Now at last Hugh must tell her what he had
done with &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;&mdash;take her to where it was hung, if it were
here in the house and not loaned to an exhibition. They would
get up and go to it together. Mrs. Weyman might excuse
them, or come too. It didn&rsquo;t matter. When she stood before it,
Ariel would be at home. Her face would be warmed by the
noon sun. Now she was chilly. Cold! She turned to Hugh, pale
with anticipation.</p>
<p>She saw his face suddenly glorified. She had seen it so once
before to-day. But now, as then, it was not for her. Mrs. Nevin
had come in unannounced and stood there under the white
radiance of the chandelier, waiting, with an amused little
smile on her lips, for them to become aware of her.</p>
<p>On the ship Joan Nevin had been muffled in furs. Even
then she had seemed to Ariel the most beautiful woman she
had ever seen. But now, in an orchid-colored dinner gown, her
coppery hair uncovered, arms, neck and bosom bare, she was
startlingly beautiful. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s she, who has &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo;&rdquo; leapt to
Ariel&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it is. Hugh bought it for her.
Ugh! <i>Is this hate?</i> It <i>hurts</i>.&rdquo; Indeed it did hurt. &ldquo;God, don&rsquo;t
let me hate. It <i>hurts</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prescott Enderly came forward almost with diffidence to be
presented. He was thinking, &ldquo;I may get to know even Michael
Schwankovsky now, if I only manage at all intelligently. God!
This is luck!&rdquo; But God was Enderly&rsquo;s expletive, not his Creator.</p>
<p>And Hugh, after his first glorified look, when first he saw
Joan, had returned to his reserve and silence. He looked at Joan
less than at any one else, and he took almost no part in the
quickening of the social atmosphere which followed her arrival.
But Ariel perceived that he could be well aware of Mrs.
Nevin without looking at her, aware of every rise and fall of
her coppery eyelashes. Why, if he had a thousand eyes and ears
he could not have known more of all she said and did, even if
he didn&rsquo;t look at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Clare? But you were on the <i>Bermuda</i>! Your chair
was next to mine. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel remembered the way Mrs. Nevin had let her steward
speak to her and had not offered a word to undo it. And Mrs.
Nevin had the violets. But she, Ariel, should now have revenge.
Strange to want revenge! She had never experienced
this dark stab of evil desire before. But all the world was different
lately,&mdash;without her father. In the old world, the
world they had had together, revenge and hate had been
nothing but words. Forever remote. But her father was dead,
and this was another world, and she was alone. Besides, revenge
would be strangely easy of attainment. For at dinner
Ariel had learned that Mrs. Nevin was a connoisseur of paintings,
and a close friend of Michael Schwankovsky&mdash;of whom
Ariel had heard her father speak often; she had not needed the
Weymans to tell her that he was a fabulously wealthy Russian,
naturalized as an American, who not only had a sound taste
in the arts, but expressed it in books and articles in which real
artists, like her father, took delight. Well, since Ariel now took
it for granted that both Mrs. Nevin and her friend, Michael
Schwankovsky, knew &ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; it would naturally be something
of a shock to her to learn that she had sat beside the artist&rsquo;s
daughter for two days, ignoring her, except for that one horrid
rudeness. Telling her was to be Ariel&rsquo;s revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was I,&rdquo; Ariel responded in her clear, flat voice. &ldquo;We
were just speaking of &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; when you came in. <i>I am Gregory
Clare&rsquo;s daughter.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman murmured quickly, &ldquo;Joan dear, you remember
I wrote you about it? Last week. Ariel is the&mdash;one I was
telling you about, that she was coming to visit us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course! Only I didn&rsquo;t put two and two together for
a minute. Stupid of me. Yes, indeed, I do know all about you&mdash;Ariel?
And do you know, I consider it rather clever of you
to have picked Mr. Weyman for a guardian.&rdquo; She just glanced
at Hugh. &ldquo;On the boat I thought you were only a little girl,
truly. You practiced some witchcraft on my babies, did you
know? They were gabbling about you when I tucked them in
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ariel said again, insisting on her revenge, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m Gregory
Clare&rsquo;s daughter.</i> &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was suddenly impressed by the somberness of Ariel&rsquo;s
tone, and her intent gaze,&mdash;almost disconcerted by it. &ldquo;Gregory
Clare?&rdquo; she asked tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prescott Enderly laughed aloud, a nervous, meaningless
laugh. And simultaneous with the young novelist&rsquo;s laugh, Mrs.
Nevin did remember&mdash;something, almost everything in fact.
&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s letter mentioned that your father was
an artist. Do you paint too, Ariel?&rdquo; But she had remembered
more. Wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; that weird painting Hugh had brought
home with him from Bermuda years ago, and produced for her
inspection, so confident that he&rsquo;d found, all by himself, a rare
masterpiece? Of course. That picture and this girl, and Hugh&rsquo;s
having been imposed on by the futile, beach-combing artist
of a father! It was all getting connected. &ldquo;Have you inherited
your father&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;talent?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Ariel was baffled. Of course now she saw she had been wrong.
Mrs. Nevin was not in possession of &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; and could never
even have seen it. But this was too unreasonable, ununderstandable.
Wasn&rsquo;t she a friend of the family&rsquo;s? They had said so,
at dinner,&mdash;an intimate and old friend, as well as the next-door
neighbor. Then what <i>had</i> Hugh done with &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;? If it
were at Wild Acres, Mrs. Nevin would be familiar with it?
What had become of it? What was the mystery?</p>
<p>Hugh also was doing some rapid thinking. &ldquo;The poor child
expects Joan to know all about her father, and particularly about
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo;! In a minute she&rsquo;ll ask me where it is. She must have
been looking around for it ever since she came. What in Heaven&rsquo;s
name did I do with it after&mdash;after Joan laughed at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hurt of that careless laugh at his mistaken taste in art
throbbed freshly, as if it had never healed. But it had healed,
and he had forgotten it, forgotten and hidden it away with the
picture which had caused the catastrophe to his vanity years
and years ago. He&rsquo;d look the thing up when he got back from
his office to-morrow and give it to Ariel for her room. But what
he would say to explain its whereabouts to-night, if she should
ask, he hadn&rsquo;t an idea. His selfish stupidity in not having foreseen
this situation shamed him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was pouring the pungent coffee into an array
of little cups on the silver tray, while Prescott Enderly stood at
attention, ready to pass them.</p>
<p>Glenn came and stood before Ariel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care about coffee, do you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Come
along into the library with me and play chess? Hugh, where&rsquo;d
we leave the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was glad to escape with Glenn into the library and feel
the familiar, friendly shapes of chessmen under her fingers.
She had played this game endlessly with her father from almost
the time of earliest remembrance. But <i>could</i> one escape
from the hurt of hating merely by leaving the room where the
hated person sat?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span></h2>
<p>Ariel stood at her window, that first morning at Wild
Acres, for some time before dressing, and looked out into the
black branches of the snow-floored woods. The trees pressed
up to the window panes. So Wild Acres was really wild. She
was curious to look from all the windows and to explore the
big, rambling house from top to bottom. After nine hours of
dreamless sleep, her body warm between sheets and light blankets,
her face deliciously cool in the cold, woodsy air of the little
guest room, Ariel had waked with a sense of happiness. The
carpet of snow in the woods below her was a thin veil, ever so
thin, drawn over the spring-to-come: green leaves, moss, butterflies,
birds, hot sunshine, cool shade and myriads and myriads
of <i>violets</i>. Hugh had promised her violets. At any moment
the veil might tremble, blow to one side, and that world
of wings and scent and color rise to the window and envelop
her with joy. But meanwhile the white, clear-smelling snow
(she had seen snow before in imagination, as she had told
Hugh, but she had never smelled it), the ebony black of bare
tree boles, roots and limbs and twigs, were all just pictures on a
veil over Spring&rsquo;s face. Ariel was glad she had come to Wild
Acres before the veil blew off. She was so happy, standing there
at the window, still in her nightgown, that she was frightened
of it. It was like too piercingly beautiful a note in music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>She felt besieged by happiness from every side. Involuntarily
she looked into the actualities of her life for escape. There were
avenues enough there, leading back into loneliness, self-distrusts
and that wide, wide avenue ending at a grave and her grief.
But strangely, they closed and shut her out when she would have
entered them. The black trees, the clear-smelling snow, and all
those hidden wings and joys of spring were opening to her, and
grief was shut.</p>
<p>As she bathed and dressed, she remembered with wonder the
mood in which she had gone to bed. She had been lonely and
dazed. Too heartsick even to cry, she had said her prayers lying
on her face in bed, without caring enough to kneel. And then,
her mind blunted by misery, she had fallen on sleep,&mdash;as Samurai
in Japanese prints fall on their swords.</p>
<p>She brushed at her hair until it glimmered to silver and every
curl had a separate life. She knew that her hair was lovely. Her
father had never tired of praising it and painting it. Ash-colored
in some lights, it was silvery in others, palest gold in others.
Sometimes it seemed the absorption of light itself. And it curled
in close, soft curls at her neck. That blond hair, and her grace
of movement, were her claims to beauty. But at the minute she
was seeing her narrow green eyes in the mirror, and her thin,
pale mouth with its pointed corners. She knew that the Weymans
must think her plain, but to-day she would not be bothered
even to care.</p>
<p>The house was very still. Not a sound. Hugh was at his place
at the dining table, reading the <i>Tribune</i> while he waited for
Rose to bring his coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>He looked his surprise. &ldquo;Hello, Ariel! But we should have
told you. The family doesn&rsquo;t breakfast until eight-thirty. It isn&rsquo;t
eight yet. I&rsquo;m catching the eight-fifteen express to town, and I
usually do grab breakfast like this alone. It&rsquo;s a twenty minutes&rsquo;
walk to the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was holding out her chair. She took it quickly so that he
might begin the breakfast which Rose was arranging at his
place. &ldquo;I thought you drove to New York,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
usually?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often, but not usually. Not when Glenn and Anne are at
home. It&rsquo;s convenient for them to have the car. Well, Rose,
what are you going to scare up for Miss Clare? She mustn&rsquo;t
wait for the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I just have some coffee, and one of those rolls, and walk
to the station with you? I should like that so much, if you don&rsquo;t
mind. I won&rsquo;t talk and disturb the morning. But I want to get
out into the snow and the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do. But why not talk? You won&rsquo;t &lsquo;disturb the
morning&rsquo; any more than the sunshine or the snow does. You&rsquo;re
that kind of a person.&rdquo; He did not feel that he was talking nonsense.
The Bermuda Ariel was here this morning, back after
five years.</p>
<p>But in spite of Hugh&rsquo;s reassurance, Ariel stuck to her bargain
and did not talk, during all their long walk out the path which
Hugh&rsquo;s previous solitary morning walks had made in the snow
through the woods and across wide fields, and finally down to
the big road and the little station. She was so silent, and her feet
went so stilly before or behind his, just as it happened, that she
actually intruded no more on his consciousness, after the first
two or three minutes, than the March sunshine, which was
wreathing the landscape in golden scarfs of light. Nor was he
thinking of the coming busy day in his Wall Street office. The
unexpectedness of Joan Nevin&rsquo;s return yesterday from her winter
months on the Riviera and in Bermuda had broken down
his recently so carefully built up resistance to her obsession of
his mind. She had swarmed back into possession, as it were,
and taken him captive. The same old tune was on again, jangling
his nerves and partially stupefying his intellect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I get to the office,&rdquo; he promised himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut this
out, stop thinking about her. The minute I sit down at my desk
I&rsquo;ll shut her out. And after this not even her unexpected appearance,
or the sudden hearing her name spoken, will jolt me
out of control of my mind again. I promise myself. I promise
myself....&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the platform of the little station the roofs of Wild Acres
could just be discerned through bare tree branches at the top of
a long upward slope of country. Ariel stood, her hands deep in
the pockets of her wonderful coat, her chin lifted, looking back
over the way they had come. Hugh, suddenly remembering
her, followed her eyes, and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Wild Acres roof. Did
you think we&rsquo;d come so far? And those windows in the attic are
Grandam&rsquo;s. If I were going to be at home this morning, I&rsquo;d
take you up to her, whether she invited us or not, first thing.
Probably, as it is, you won&rsquo;t see her till dinner to-night,&mdash;if
then. But if Grandam does appear before I get back don&rsquo;t let
her scare you. She&rsquo;s not really mysterious and awesome. Quite
an ordinary human being. Remember that. And you might
tell Mother that I&rsquo;ll try to get out rather early this afternoon.
Good-by, Ariel, and thanks for your company. It&rsquo;s very pleasant
being seen off like this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>From the steps of the moving train he looked back at her.
It was pleasant, in all conscience&mdash;now that he had at the last
minute possible waked up to it,&mdash;having a friendly girl, with a
friendly, sympathetic light in her green eyes, smiling from under
a green hat, waving him off. And the green feather on the hat,
as the train rushed away, seemed as smiling and friendly as the
eyes. Ariel and her green feather! There was something sympathetic
among the three of them, Ariel, the green feather, and
Hugh himself. Something living and vital. And how glad he
was that he had hit on that particular coat for her! It went with
the fairy-tale hat, the fairy-tale eyes. He took joy in his gift.</p>
<p>After the train had rushed out of the landscape, Ariel stood
on the platform for a moment longer, the only visible sentient
thing in the whole morning world,&mdash;a morning world that
cried, &ldquo;Come, Come, Come. Dive, swim, run through me, come
into my heart! I love you as your beach at home loves you, as
the sea loves you. Come quickly. Every step since you left Wild
Acres&rsquo; door you have been getting nearer. Come all the way
now. Into my heart. Into the heart within my heart. Into its
<i>beat</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Oh, Ariel was happy!</p>
<p>She had made her bed and arranged her possessions in closets
and drawers before going downstairs. She saw no reason now
why she should return to the house. The moth, no doubt, would
tell Mrs. Weyman that she had accompanied Hugh to the station,
and when she did not come back, they would understand
that she had gone for a walk, and not bother about her. She
started down the stairs from the train platform slowly, and
then, more quickly, walked away into March sunlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The children and their guest are still sleeping. Hugh&rsquo;s
guest got up early, and went to the station with him. She hasn&rsquo;t
come back yet, and it&rsquo;s nearly eleven. But that&rsquo;s all right, I suppose.
It&rsquo;s a difficult position Hugh&rsquo;s put us in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was paying her daily visit to Grandam in the
attic apartment. Usually she went up soon after lunch, because
Grandam liked her mornings clear. Clear for what, no one in
the family, except Grandam herself, could have said; not even
Miss Peters, her nurse-attendant, who might, if any one, be
supposed to know how she spent the solitude she so highly
prized. But Miss Peters herself was banished for hours every
morning and she was neither prying nor curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my coming up so early, do you?&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman
inquired belatedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interrupting anything, am
I?&rdquo; It was obvious that she wasn&rsquo;t. She had found Grandam
lying on her daybed, exquisitely costumed for the day, as
usual, looking down across the woods to the Hudson. She
hadn&rsquo;t even a book in her hand. &ldquo;I felt suddenly in need of
sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said it charmingly, and settled down in a low chair, which
she had drawn close to the daybed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the girl I want to talk
about, of course. Hugh&rsquo;s Ariel Clare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m interested, of course. What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad. Well bred. Better bred than Anne, in fact. But that&rsquo;s
not putting it strongly enough, for Anne&rsquo;s manners these days
are barbarous. It&rsquo;s nothing about Ariel herself that bothers me.
It&rsquo;s what we are to do with her! The only gauche thing about
her is a seeming obsession about her father. She takes it for
granted he was a great artist and that this exhibition of his
paintings, when it comes off, will edify the entire art world.
But Joan assures us it&rsquo;s all nonsense. The exhibition, if it comes
through, will be a farce. And what are we to do then? I don&rsquo;t
believe Ariel has enough actual cash to take her back to Bermuda
when it&rsquo;s all over. And even if she has, she probably
won&rsquo;t want to go. So far as one can discover she hasn&rsquo;t a relative
and hardly a friend in the world,&mdash;and no education, no
training for anything in particular. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so appalling,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Hugh means to help her to something, doesn&rsquo;t he? Her
father surely expected&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! That&rsquo;s just it! Oh, Mother Weyman! Why should
Hugh have this absurd sense of responsibility toward a stranger!
Hasn&rsquo;t he enough on his shoulders, poor dear! And what can
he do for her, anyway? He&rsquo;s not wealthy. We spend pretty well
what he makes each month. It&rsquo;s dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he might manage to send her to business school for a
year or two. He spoke of that, I believe, if the exhibition should
be a disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where would she live? Here? And go in on the early
train with Hugh, I suppose! But I won&rsquo;t let such an absurdity
happen. She can&rsquo;t live here. And Hugh <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> finance her.
Why should he? It&rsquo;s too unfair!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Grandam looked at her daughter-in-law with some surprise.
Hortense was rarely so intense or emphatic about anything,
even big things. And the present problem, if it was a problem,
seemed so far, at least, not really serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather crossing bridges, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked, but
not without sympathy. &ldquo;The exhibition has yet to prove itself
a failure, no matter what Joan has said. How can she be so sure?
She hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with it, has she? It&rsquo;s some one else
entirely. One of the young Frye&rsquo;s. I knew his father and his
uncle, by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you? But Joan says that he, this boy, doesn&rsquo;t amount to
anything. That Ariel can&rsquo;t count on him. He&rsquo;s a lightweight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? Well, Joan herself is in a position to do something, isn&rsquo;t
she? Why doesn&rsquo;t <i>she</i> take the exhibition in hand? Make it a
success? Or is she diffident about putting her influence to the
actual test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last few words were spoken not without malice, but Mrs.
Weyman passed that over. &ldquo;Joan wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, of course.
The only work of this man Clare&rsquo;s she ever saw was a picture
Hugh brought home, years ago. It wasn&rsquo;t any good. Freakish as
well as amateurish, if I remember what she said then. She
laughed at it, anyway, and Hugh gave up being a collector on
the spot and hid the thing away in the attic. Every spring cleaning
since, I&rsquo;ve been in two minds whether to send it off to the
dump or give it to some rummage sale or other. I haven&rsquo;t liked
to do either without speaking to Hugh, and it happens he&rsquo;s
never around at the time. So there it stands against the chimney,&mdash;an
&aelig;sthetic treat to the spiders, no doubt. And that&rsquo;s
that for Ariel&rsquo;s father as an artist, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam wasn&rsquo;t deeply impressed. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s one of his
poorer things,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Or he may have improved during
the years. Or Joan might have been wrong. So far, I don&rsquo;t
see that it&rsquo;s at all final.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear! I do wish you had been down last night! Ariel
solemnly informed us that the hour her father died he was still
proclaiming Hugh&rsquo;s sample of her father&rsquo;s work his masterpiece.
The other paintings are wonderful, of course, but not
quite so wonderful. Even so, they are to bring in several hundreds
of dollars a canvas, and Ariel confidently expects to have
a fortune from them. It isn&rsquo;t the child&rsquo;s fault, of course. It&rsquo;s the
father&rsquo;s. He must have been an extraordinarily conceited and
stupid person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam at this outburst of strong feeling withdrew her
gaze&mdash;reluctantly, it seemed&mdash;from the sun-spangled, snowy
world beyond her windows, and gave her more concentrated
attention to her daughter-in-law. &ldquo;How does Hugh himself
feel about the situation?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s in no position to judge,&rdquo; Hortense responded impatiently.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Joan&rsquo;s opinion I trust. She&rsquo;s just home from six
weeks at St. George&rsquo;s, and among all her artist friends staying
there she never even heard the name of Gregory Clare once.
That in itself is enough, isn&rsquo;t it? Joan says that impossible
would-be artists and writers and people like that often do think
themselves geniuses, no matter what the world tells them to the
contrary; but it&rsquo;s seldom their families are tainted with the
same megalomania. And this Ariel&rsquo;s not just tainted. She&rsquo;s
poisoned. Why, she&rsquo;s not <i>sane</i> on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all of that Joan? She hasn&rsquo;t spared Hugh&rsquo;s friend or the
friend&rsquo;s daughter, has she!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman regained her poise. &ldquo;Oh, of course you don&rsquo;t
like Joan. I keep forgetting that. You even hope she won&rsquo;t
marry Hugh. After all these years of his devotion, and their
truly wonderful friendship! But even feeling as you do, it isn&rsquo;t
like you to be so prejudiced. Joan does know about painting
and painters. She&rsquo;d see this Ariel Clare business and the problems
involved more clearly than anybody else we happen to
know. Besides, she&rsquo;s ready to help Hugh with it, if only he&rsquo;ll
be a little tactful. I can see that. She has interested herself in
working girls and their problems for years. She would, with a
little encouragement from us, get Ariel into a good working
girls&rsquo; home or club, I know, and find a way for her to earn
money at the same time that she was learning a trade. But there
has to be all this time wasted waiting for the exhibition, and
Hugh&rsquo;s absurd heroics about Gregory Clare&rsquo;s having been his
great friend, and having entrusted Ariel to him. It&rsquo;s too tiresome.
And not exactly fair to the family&mdash;this family&mdash;do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Joan who constitutes a problem, to my mind. My dear
Hortense, really, why do you want Hugh to marry a stupid
woman like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman did not wince. She even replied in a humoring
voice, because her mother-in-law, wonderful as she was in some
ways, was peculiar enough in others, every one knew. &ldquo;Joan
stupid!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brilliant, yes, and stupid, yes. But why do you want Hugh
to marry a brilliant-stupid woman, then, like Mrs. Nevin?
Hugh&rsquo;s not brilliant, and neither is he stupid. So both ways he&rsquo;d
be embarrassed with her. He&rsquo;s much too simple and ordinary
for Joan. He&rsquo;d be miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s humoring of her mother-in-law turned almost
into merriment. &ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s as far from ordinary as dear
Joan herself,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not because of either of
their gifts or brains or anything of the sort that I want him to
get her, if he can. It&rsquo;s because he happens to be in love with
her. He&rsquo;s been that way ever since she was fourteen and he
fifteen, when she came to Tarrytown with her parents, and they
bought the Manor from the Careys. You were in India and
China those years? It was charming, that boy and girl romance.
We thought&mdash;we took it for granted&mdash;they&rsquo;d marry the minute
they were old enough, and Hugh had a profession. Till
Nevin appeared. What girl wouldn&rsquo;t have her head turned by
the attentions of a man like that! Untold wealth, world-famous,
and looking like a Greek God. Even being Hugh&rsquo;s mother
didn&rsquo;t make me blame Joan. It was infatuation, not love, though.
She has always loved Hugh. Not been in love with him. Perhaps
never that. But loved him. Something deeper than infatuation
or mere passion. I have seen it. I know more about Joan
than she knows about herself. Hugh&rsquo;s the first person she always
turns to, thinks of. Yesterday, for instance, Michael
Schwankovsky met her at the docks and brought her out to
Holly. He and two or three other people, almost as important
and interesting, are at Holly over the week-end. But just the
same, last night she came to us after dinner and stayed an hour
or more. She didn&rsquo;t leave her guests to see <i>me</i>, I assure you. It
was Hugh. It&rsquo;s rather wonderful, watching it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Grandam stirred restlessly among her pillows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never
spoken quite so plainly before. My dear Hortense, do you seriously
want Joan Nevin, after having married some one else,
had two children by him, and inherited his wealth, to marry
Hugh now? If she&rsquo;d taken him the year after Nevin died or
even the second year, they might have made something of it.
But certainly the time for that has passed. She&rsquo;s picked him up
and thrown him down too many times. It amuses her, of course.
No, it&rsquo;s much deeper than amusement. It feeds her. She&rsquo;s gorged
her vanity on it for years. That&rsquo;s what she loves in Hugh, his
food-value! His romantic, silent, dark devotion. Other people
are always falling in love with her, of course. But there&rsquo;s no one
quite like Hugh. There wouldn&rsquo;t be in the twentieth century.
His unchanging passion is the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> of her gluttonous
vanity. And Joan&rsquo;s vanity, I&rsquo;ve noticed, has become herself.
It&rsquo;s absorbed the soul she was born with. I don&rsquo;t know
which is more stupid: to think you&rsquo;re a great painter when
you aren&rsquo;t even a little artist&mdash;or to think you are a real person,
a worthy human being, when you are nothing but a mass
of festering vanity. If you really want Hugh to marry that, and
wake up too late, or never wake up at all, and so prove himself
an imbecile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hortense would not listen to more. She had pushed back
her chair and was at the door. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost horrifying, Mother
Weyman! Joan is a friend of mine. I admire her and I&rsquo;m deeply
fond of her. You know that very well. I&rsquo;m sorry I interrupted
your morning retreat. It would have been much better if I
hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, but wholly artificially, into the glare of March
sunshine with the blur, somewhere at the center of it, which
was Grandam, before shutting the door with careful softness
between them.</p>
<p class="tb">Ariel was enjoying her solitary explorations in Wild Acres&rsquo;
woods. The snow was not deep, and by following paths part of
the time, and keeping to ridges the rest of the time, she avoided
going too often over her rubbers. Woods in March! The stillness
of them! The mystery! Beauty dumb. But not Beauty inarticulate.
A girl had leapt a brook whose summer loveliness
was stilled to ice, and stood on the other side, circled by beauty
that was making itself articulate in her very veins&mdash;no need for
sight, touch or smell. Winter woods have communications that
can overleap the senses altogether on their avenues to the soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Whenever Ariel came to a rise of ground she looked for the
house, in order to keep her bearings, and because the attic windows,
which Hugh had pointed out from the station platform,
fascinated her. She noticed that although they were dormer
windows they were of an unusual height and width. After
a while she had almost a sense of the windows being eyes that
followed her, knew and cared about her adventures with the
woods.</p>
<p>Twice Hugh had warned her, once on the drive out from
New York, and again this morning at the station, that his
grandmother was not <i>mysterious</i>. But why emphasize it so?
Ariel would never have thought of mystery in connection with
the old lady up there if it hadn&rsquo;t been for these protests. Some
hint of mysteriousness had showed even in Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s face
last night, when she said in answer to a question from Joan
that the shawl she was knitting was for Grandam, and even
more in the faces of the others. At the words, a ripple of incredulity
had gone over the room. Why, if Mrs. Weyman had
said &ldquo;This shawl? Oh, it&rsquo;s for Spring. I thought she might be
chilly, if she gets here early, dear Spring,&rdquo;&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t
have looked more incredulous for just that instant. And then,
when any one had spoken of the likelihood or unlikelihood
of Grandam&rsquo;s coming downstairs to join them after dinner, they
might as well have been asking, &ldquo;Will the wind blow? Will it
rain? Do you think a bird may fly across the window?&rdquo; It was
like that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>And as Ariel went on, stealing, running, walking, and jumping
across brooks and over hollows, she began, almost, to hope
to come upon this mysterious person, this elusive house fairy
of a grandmother, out here at some turn in the lovely stillness.
She might discover her standing, leaning an arm against the
other side of that dark tree bole just beyond,&mdash;or lying asleep
among these feathery snowy plumes of bush which she had
been about to pass with too careless a glance.&mdash;Will it snow?
Will a bird start from this thicket if I make a noise? When shall
I see Grandam?</p>
<p>Then she heard laughter. But it was sudden, human laughter.
Not for an instant did she think that it might be Grandam,
mysteriously laughing. For she knew that it was children&rsquo;s
voices, and children she had heard laughing before on the
<i>Bermuda</i>. Nicky and Persis must be somewhere not far away,
playing in these woods. Perhaps, she, Ariel, was a trespasser
and had got over into the grounds of Holly without realizing
it.</p>
<p>Around the next tree she saw them. They were beneath her,
in an open hollow at the foot of what might be a rock garden
when spring came. And yes, up beyond the garden there were
rolling stretches of white lawn and hedges marking off other
gardens. But the house was not in sight. Perhaps that grove of
fir trees stood at just the angle to conceal it. At any rate, there
were the children, in navy blue coats with brass buttons, scarlet
sashes around their waists, and scarlet tam-o&rsquo;-shanters on their
heads, pushing at a big snowball, higher than themselves, which
they had rolled up in the hollow.</p>
<p>The snow there was just right, melted by the sun to a perfect
consistency for packing. And everywhere that the white ball
had traveled, the earth was left bare in wet, brown, leaf-mold
patches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Ariel called, going down toward them. Their recognition
was instantaneous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the green feather!&rdquo; Persis exclaimed,
running to meet her. But Nicky stayed where he was
and merely said, when she came to him, &ldquo;Hello. We thought
you&rsquo;d come, soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel dug a toe of her rubber into the leaf mold and stirred
it up. The pungent scent of earth assailed her. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; And then, meeting Nicky&rsquo;s glad-grave eyes, exclaimed,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Summer! Or Spring? Anyway, <i>I smell violets</i>. Big
purple ones, long green-stemmed violets. Little pearly white
ones too. And yellow ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Persis agreed, jumping around her. &ldquo;In the spring
there are bushels and tons and <i>quarts</i> of violets right here. A
whole valley of &rsquo;em. Mother leaves it wild. She didn&rsquo;t plant
&rsquo;em. They came. But you can&rsquo;t smell them yet. Even the leaves
aren&rsquo;t through yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do smell them. Anyway, I feel them coming. Let&rsquo;s
dance. Come, let&rsquo;s dance to meet them.&rdquo; Ariel&rsquo;s happiness was
overflowing, bubbling up before these children. All the morning,
since waking and discovering that happiness had come to
her in sleep, she had held it still, within herself. But now this
unexpected meeting with the children, and more particularly
Nicky&rsquo;s glad-grave eyes, had broken down her reserve. She was
at one with the children, as spontaneous as they in what she said
and did. &ldquo;Come, dance,&rdquo; she laughed, wrinkling her eyes like a
merry little girl, eyes very narrow, very green in the sunlight,
and snatched at their hands.</p>
<p>But they were new at this game. <i>They</i> did not dance as easily
as they laughed or sang to express their happiness. And their
clumsy overshoes dragged over the ground. Ariel let them go.
Stood for a minute, let down by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dance!&rdquo; Persis cried. &ldquo;Dance like your feather danced
in the wind on deck. Be a feather. Nicky says you and the
feather are really twins, only the feather has been magic&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nicky denied calmly, and still grave. &ldquo;I said <i>she</i> had
been magic&rsquo;d into a human. She and the fairy feather were twins
before the magicking. You are mixed up, Persis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Ariel assured them quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a real girl. I
haven&rsquo;t been magic&rsquo;d from something else. Truly. But I&rsquo;ll
dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped out of her coat, tossed it behind her into the
snowy woods whence she had appeared to the children. It lay
in a heap there on the wet snow, hardly distinguishable from
snow in its own whiteness. But a touch of the scarlet lining&mdash;it
might have been crushed red winterberries, though&mdash;gave
it away. She threw her green hat down somewhere else. Kicked
her rubbers off anywhere. And began to dance.</p>
<p>She danced to meet the violets. She danced right through the
leaf mold into their golden mysterious hearts. And the music
she danced to was the unheard rhythms of earth and sky and
woods. But sometimes she hummed, beelike, beneath her
breath. Her clinging green jersey frock etched her figure sharply
against the black-violet-white background of the woods. Two
hairpins slipped down her neck, and then her hair was of the
rhythm. Pale gold on the air. Like March sunshine.</p>
<p>Soon the patterns of the rhythms she was attuned to took
her in wider and wider circles. Then crescents. Then stars. The
children backed away farther and farther from the reach of the
dance, but never for an instant did their fascinated eyes leave
the heart of the lovely patterns of music and stars and moons,
the heart that was the dancing Ariel. They knew that she was
dancing happiness, that all this glamour and beautifulness of
motion and that low humming they heard sometimes through
it all, were happiness. But they thought it came from their own
hearts. They scarcely separated their happiness, while she
danced, from the dancer&rsquo;s. She was their happiness come out of
their hearts into form and motion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>So, when the dance slowed, it was as though the world and
even the firmament and their own hearts were all slowing
down together. Then she was standing perfectly still. As before,
Persis and Nicky had never taken part in beautiful motion,
so now they had never taken part in such lovely stillness.
This Ariel was smiling at them. A smile of poignant sympathy.
It was a smile that pointed the corners of her lips brightly
like little darts of silver flame. She held out her hands to them
again. They came to her as they had come yesterday morning
on the sun deck, with perfect assurance, but sensitive delicacy.
Slowly, their hands in hers, with clumsy but happy feet, they
walked a circle with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span></h2>
<p>That night Hugh did not return to dinner, in spite of
his message delivered by Ariel. Already, before she had returned
to the house after her wood&rsquo;s adventure with Persis and Nicky,
Hugh had telephoned from his office in New York that sudden
and important business was taking him to Chicago, and
asked that Glenn bring him a bag to the Grand Central with
enough clothes in it for a week at least.</p>
<p>It was Hugh Ariel&rsquo;s father had sent her to, to await the exhibition,
and her consent to come had been because it was her
father&rsquo;s plan for her, and she had taken it for granted that
both he and Hugh were in agreement about its reasonableness.
But now that she was here, and Hugh away off in the States
somewhere, Ariel felt that her presence at Wild Acres was unexplainable,
not only to others but to herself. If Hugh had only
sent a message back to her by Glenn, who took him his bag,
or if he should write her a letter from Chicago, it might tie her
down, save her from this sense of floating in her environment
without an anchor. But if Hugh had sent a good-by message
by Glenn, Glenn had forgotten to mention it, and although several
times Ariel started to ask him about it, she never quite
brought herself to the point; for if Glenn should be certain
that there was no message, then Ariel was afraid of the desolation
which she would feel. And no letter came by the post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Anne might have counteracted Ariel&rsquo;s consciousness of her
peculiar position at Wild Acres but for the fact, which Ariel had
discovered for herself quite soon, that Anne was not here in her
home, in any true sense at all. She might look at you and speak
to you, even turn up her lips in a smile in your direction, but
she was no more conscious of you, really, or of her surroundings,
than the grotesque dolls of which she had at first reminded
Ariel. She was alive and conscious in her relations with one other
person only,&mdash;Prescott Enderly. It was his voice and look and
touch which controlled the beating of her heart and pulled the
strings of her mechanism. Ariel saw this, and it was rather
frightening to see it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact Anne had few opportunities for making
Ariel feel at home. She was off with Enderly skiing or teaing
or dancing, all day and most of the nights. They were even included
in one or two parties at Holly. This was plainly very
gratifying to Anne, in spite of her dislike of Joan Nevin, for
never before had she even hoped to meet the celebrities who
fluttered around Holly&rsquo;s hospitality. To become intimate with
such a brilliant and well-known group of people, even though
most of them were, from her point of view, quite aged, was
something to talk about after vacation, back at college. That she
owed the privilege of these contacts to Prescott Enderly only
added to the headiness of it. Already his fame had given Anne
a glamour with undergraduates and even faculty at Smith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Glenn spent very little time with his friend or any one else.
He was deep in Spengler, adventuring with his own mind,
this vacation. He had expected Prescott, when he invited him to
Wild Acres, to read Spengler with him part of the time and
write the rest of the time on that novel he ought to be getting
done. But from the first hour of their arrival Glenn had seen
that opportunity for such occupations was not precisely the lure
which had brought Prescott to the country. That was all right
with Glenn. If Prescott preferred Anne&rsquo;s company to his, well,
he was fond enough of Prescott to want him to have what he
wanted. Besides, Spengler was enough for Glenn. He felt no
need of further stimulation. Ariel, with whom he would play
chess for an hour or two after dinner, was less a girl to him
than an atmosphere, at first. He felt her as one feels the clear
depths of a stream one may be sitting near, or music one isn&rsquo;t
intellectually following, but which creates a mood all the
same.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman, those evenings of Hugh&rsquo;s absence, was deep
in books on psychoanalysis. It was a recent interest with her
and apparently absorbing. She was so occupied just at this time
with finding explanations for the things which had hitherto
baffled her in her children, her friends and even in herself, that
she was saved from too much concern over the stranger under
her roof.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Grandam is coming down for lunch. I&rsquo;m glad we all happen
to be at home, now that she&rsquo;s able to join us again. You
haven&rsquo;t met her yet, have you, Prescott? And Ariel hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the third day of Hugh&rsquo;s absence and Ariel&rsquo;s loneliness.</p>
<p>Anne laughed. &ldquo;Well, neither have I, if it comes to that,
Mother. Not this vacation. Do you realize? Each time I&rsquo;ve tried
to go up to say &lsquo;Howdy,&rsquo; that old Peters of hers has come across
with some excuse or other. She was asleep. Or away on a journey....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now!&rdquo; Enderly interrupted. &ldquo;Your grandmother isn&rsquo;t
a heathen god, is she? You&rsquo;ve made her pretty mysterious, you
and Glenn,&mdash;but this is the first time you&rsquo;ve been so definite in
your implications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> mysterious. And I didn&rsquo;t know you knew your Bible,
bright boy! But you might think she&rsquo;d care to see her only
granddaughter, who hasn&rsquo;t been at home since Christmas,
wouldn&rsquo;t you? She&rsquo;s getting so exclusive there&rsquo;s no living with
her&mdash;literally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was looking at the clock. Rose had come in to
the library some minutes ago to announce luncheon, and if
Grandam was joining them at last, it did seem as if she might
take a little trouble to be on time. &ldquo;My mother-in-law is not
very strong,&rdquo; she explained for Enderly&rsquo;s benefit. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s forced
to spend her strength very circumspectly. And people tire her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn shut his book. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t soft pedal so, Mother! We all
know that it&rsquo;s the people who happen to bore Grandam that
tire her. She&rsquo;s an everlasting snob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne laughed again. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t insult your friend, the famous
novelist, if that&rsquo;s your aim, sonny. Grandam wouldn&rsquo;t know
whether Pressy bored her until she met him, would she? No.
This time health will have to be accepted as Grandam&rsquo;s alibi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of Prescott, of course. Of you, dear sister.
But we&rsquo;re both in the same boat. Mother too. I think every last
one of us bores Grandam, except Hugh. When he gets back,
you&rsquo;ll notice she&rsquo;ll be down for lunch <i>and</i> dinner rather frequently.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s five minutes past now. And Rose sounded the gong
in the back hall, so they know up there that lunch is waiting.
Perhaps Grandam has changed her mind, after all. I think
we&rsquo;ll go in.&rdquo; Glenn, bringing up the rear of the procession
dining-roomward called out, &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Ariel Grandam&rsquo;s shy
of. <i>She</i> isn&rsquo;t a famous novelist or anything else famous. She&rsquo;s
not even a member of an old New York family. Grandam may
feel that it&rsquo;s too much of a chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Glenn!&rdquo; his mother expostulated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of all
this rudeness. Besides, we all know perfectly well that Grandam
is more democratic than any other member of this family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel&rsquo;s face was flushed as Glenn pulled out her chair for her.
But it was Mrs. Weyman, not Glenn, who had hurt her. Glenn,
noticing the flush, was conscious for a minute of Ariel as a girl
as well as an atmosphere. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said, under his breath.
&ldquo;It was my fault. Mother doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing. She&rsquo;s just
gauche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were hardly seated when a woman dressed in a gray-and-white
semi-uniform appeared, carrying some violet pillows
and with a wide scarf of violet gossamer floating incongruously
from one arm. This was Miss Peters, Grandam&rsquo;s attendant. She
was neither a nurse nor a maid, but a combination of the two.
For the attendant of a mystery she was commonplace-looking
enough,&mdash;strong, wholesome, with pleasantly regular features
and becomingly marcelled hair. She was middle-aged and middle
everything else, one surmised. She went to the foot of the
table&mdash;Hugh&rsquo;s vacant place&mdash;and put the cushions one on the
seat, two at the back of the big armed chair there. Now it had
the look of a throne. It was very impressive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Every one was looking toward the door, even Miss Peters, expectantly.
And Ariel, strangely, experienced again a touch, at
least, of the sense of spring coming, the imminence of personal
happiness, she had experienced and lost again her first morning
at Wild Acres. She remembered the leaf mold where the
children had rolled up the snowball and how she had danced
across it into the center of spring-happiness. Now, while Miss
Peters&rsquo; sensible profile was turned away toward the door, and
the others waited, napkins half unfolded in their hands, Ariel
looked for veils to blow aside&mdash;and wonder to appear. Strange,
when it was just an old lady who was coming, so old and so
feeble that she had to be comforted in her chair with pillows.</p>
<p>Grandam was in the doorway, and every one rose, except
Mrs. Weyman. Introductions were made, and then Mr. Enderly
and Miss Peters were both holding out the throne chair.
When Grandam was established, Miss Peters dropped the
scarf over the high back of the throne where it hung like a
trailing wing and quietly withdrew.</p>
<p>Grandam was beautiful.... But Ariel had known she would
be all the time, though no one had ever hinted it, just as she
knew that summer in Wild Acres woods would be beautiful,
though it was hidden now from sensible knowing under snow
and rain, and no one spoke of it. She was no age at all. To
think &ldquo;well preserved&rdquo; of her would be too stupid. Here was
nothing static, but something glamorously in the process of
creation. Hugh&rsquo;s mother, whom until now Ariel had thought
so surprisingly young, was flattened and dulled by contrast with
her mother-in-law. It was not Grandam&rsquo;s clothes or make-up
that made her young. They had nothing to do with it but were
merely exquisite accessories to the exhilarating, lovely person
herself. Her eyes, when she met them, took Ariel&rsquo;s breath. They
were violet, long and enchantingly shaped, under finely drawn,
dark eyebrows, and fringed with straight, dense lashes. Her
hair was both beautiful and strange. It was cut short and
dressed into a close-curling crown that looked like wrought
silver in its arbitrary design, a close-fitting crown, worn low. It
was a frame for the exquisite small face, with its short straight
nose, its lovely, poignant mouth, and those breath-taking, violet,
dark-fringed eyes. She was wearing a red-violet frock&mdash;or perhaps
it was more the color of fireweed than of violets&mdash;with
long deep sleeves like a nun&rsquo;s, but unlike a nun&rsquo;s they were
chiffon, and folded her arms like half-spread wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Prescott Enderly was as enthralled as Ariel. No one had happened
to tell him, any more than her, that Grandam was beautiful.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasant, having you down
again, Mother Weyman. The vacation ends in another two
days, and Mr. Enderly wanted to meet you. You will enjoy
each other. Mrs. Weyman is a great reader, Prescott. She knew
about your book, from the reviews, before I did, and said it
must be Glenn&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam&rsquo;s violet eyes rested on the young novelist briefly,
but she did not follow her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s lead and begin
speaking of his work. Instead she passed him by for Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry you haven&rsquo;t come up at a time when I could see you,
Anne,&rdquo; she said in a voice which surprised only by being so
fitting&mdash;a low voice, but light, and casual as a bird&rsquo;s flight is
casual. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve had such a jolly vacation. It isn&rsquo;t often,
is it, that Smith&rsquo;s and Yale&rsquo;s spring vacations coincide?&rdquo; Nothing
that Grandam said was remarkable, or by the greatest
stretch of the fascinated onlooker&rsquo;s imagination could be
thought important. It was all talk of the most everyday things&mdash;the
weather, Glenn&rsquo;s and Anne&rsquo;s plans for the long summer
vacation, her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s plans for some serious landscape
gardening at Wild Acres; and Hugh&rsquo;s protracted absence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>She could not have had a very vital interest in any of these
things she talked about and heard talked about during this
meal. Yet, when she spoke to any one or listened to any one in
particular, that person had a sense of vital contact, of swift,
actual sympathy. This was not because Grandam was insincere.
Quite the contrary. She was, even in these casual contacts, as
sincere as the flight of a bird is sincere, direct, absolutely unstudied,
intuitional. As it happened that she looked or listened
to Glenn, Mrs. Weyman, Anne, or Prescott, then Glenn, Mrs.
Weyman, Anne or Prescott quickened, grew alive&mdash;behaved
the way those Japanese toy flowers behave when dropped into
water; their personalities expanded, took form and pattern.
Ariel saw this, and the simile of the Japanese flowers was hers.</p>
<p>As for herself, Ariel was aware that Grandam was aware of
her even when she seemed most absorbed in the others. Several
times the violet eyes had swept her, lightly but not blindly. And
with dessert, when Mrs. Weyman had succeeded in an attempt
she had intermittently been making to draw Enderly out, during
the meal, and show Grandam how much of a person this
guest of theirs really was, and he was in the middle of an anecdote
which had to do with a recent party in a famous New York
studio&mdash;an anecdote studded and aglitter with famous and
near-famous names&mdash;Grandam suddenly turned to Ariel, and
without any real impoliteness to Enderly, for after all he was
sitting beside Mrs. Weyman at the other end of the table, and
had her undivided, individual attention, said, &ldquo;They tell me
that your father was a painter. Do you care about that? Do you
paint or want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t talent&mdash;of any sort. That is the trouble. (One
instinctively told this lady the trouble, because, no matter what
that casual, low voice of hers actually said, the violet eyes said,
&lsquo;Here is sympathetic understanding of the most poignant, rarest
kind. Snatch it. It has winged your way. Snatch it on the
wing.&rsquo;) But, if one didn&rsquo;t have to have a high-school education
first, I&rsquo;d like to get hospital training as a nurse. That is what
I&rsquo;d like to do, of the things by which one earns money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;And of the things by which one does not&mdash;earn money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well! Ariel was plunging now through ether on a very swift
flight, beside Grandam&rsquo;s flight. Careless flight. So she answered
with truth as winged-casual as Grandam&rsquo;s own, &ldquo;A mother. I&rsquo;d
like to have children. (But she saw them as the age of Nicky and
Persis, dancing with her out of winter into spring.) Or be a
lover. Or be a sailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have genius for any one of those three occupations you
have something that will keep you alive all your life. Children.
Passion. Adventure. And you have fairy-tale eyes. Has any one
ever told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flight was very swift, very sure. At its height it must
burst into a fountain of song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has. And he didn&rsquo;t mind their being narrow and
green. Oh, Grandam! Why didn&rsquo;t you come down sooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she might have cried, &ldquo;Oh, I have been lonely! And you
have taken that away, absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had heard what they had been saying or noticed anything
except that Grandam had not listened to that amusing
anecdote of Enderly&rsquo;s so bedecked with famous names. And
they were preparing to rise now. Luncheon was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s out for the first time in days,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman exclaimed.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like Glenn to take you out in Hugh&rsquo;s
car for a while, Grandam? Anne will run up and bring down
your things. Later we&rsquo;re all going to a tea-dance over at Holly.
Joan&rsquo;s being very nice to us! But now I know Glenn would be
glad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The sun was shining,&mdash;windy, gold afternoon sunlight.
They all went out under the portico together to watch Grandam
and Glenn off, in Hugh&rsquo;s roadster. Anne&rsquo;s arm was linked
carelessly in Ariel&rsquo;s. As they turned back into the hall Enderly
cried&mdash;now that Grandam was out of hearing, he was the
brash young novelist again&mdash;&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s magnificent, that
woman. Sarah Bernhardt couldn&rsquo;t have managed it any better!
(He meant old age, of course.) Some one should have prepared
me for her beauty, though. Once she must have been almost too
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her hair&rsquo;s always been like that, pure silver ever since I remember,&rdquo;
Anne told him. And Mrs. Weyman enlarged upon it.
&ldquo;Ever since Anne&rsquo;s grandfather died, a few days after Anne&rsquo;s
father was born, it&rsquo;s been gray. Grandam was young then,
hardly twenty. It happened as it happens in romances but never
supposedly in real life. Her hair went white in a night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver,&rdquo; Enderly corrected. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing white about it.
It&rsquo;s silver, like bubbles in the sun. Not silver like Ariel&rsquo;s. Ariel,
you&rsquo;ve got queer hair. But it&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s the color of copper wire
to-day. What turned <i>your</i> hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel laughed, and her fairy-tale eyes squinted to green slits
with merriment. She laughed with them all. She could have
danced. Was she going to be really happy again? Was happiness
a wave, buoying up the whole of her life, a wave that <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i>
be kept out, that <i>would</i> flood and make a freshet of her heart&mdash;even
with her father dead? And buried? Oh, but he was buried
in the wave, not in the earth. That was the secret.</p>
<p>She started up to her room to get her coat. She would get
out quickly. With the sun shining like this, Persis and Nicky
must be somewhere near their playground. She would find
them. She couldn&rsquo;t help finding them, now when she was so
happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>But she did not open the door to her room. With her hand on
the knob, it came to her: of course Grandam had &ldquo;Noon.&rdquo; It was
hanging all this time in her attic apartment. Hugh adored
Grandam, and he would never be so selfish as not to insist that
she have the picture up there, where she lived so constantly alone.
How dull Ariel had been not to have guessed sooner! But no
wonder she had looked up at those windows from the woods
day after day with a sense that there was relief from loneliness
if she could only reach up to it. &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; had been there, with
Grandam, waiting for her all the while. The beach. The sunlight.
The green water. And Gregory Clare&rsquo;s love of his daughter
made visible, dancing. That is what herself in her father&rsquo;s
paintings meant to Ariel,&mdash;not a picture of herself, but a picture
of his love for her. She saw herself no more when she looked at
his painting than she saw herself when she looked into his
eyes.</p>
<p>But must she wait until Grandam and Glenn get back from
their drive to go up and make sure that, after all her disappointments,
&ldquo;Noon&rdquo; was there, safe with Grandam? Miss Peters
would let her in.</p>
<p>She had forgotten that Grandam&rsquo;s first words to her at luncheon
had been &ldquo;They tell me that your father was a painter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Noon&rdquo; would have made that speech impossible, if Grandam
had the picture. But their flight together into understanding
had followed that opening too swiftly for Ariel to remember it
now.</p>
<p>How did one get to the attic? Were there stairs? She had
heard mention of an elevator. But she wouldn&rsquo;t know how to
run an elevator. There must be stairs as well. She hurried away
to look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span></h2>
<p>Ariel found the attic stairs in the wing opposite hers at
the other end of the house. At the top she came out into a long
hall. It was almost dark up here, the only light coming through
two low little dormer windows at the farthest end. Ariel had
never in real life been in an attic, but she had been in plenty of
them in books, and this long, dim hall with narrow doors in its
walls somehow did not seem like her imagined attics.</p>
<p>Behind which of the several doors would she find Grandam&rsquo;s
living room? And above all, through which door would she
come to &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;? No wonder the dim hall was as fascinating as
a fairy-tale&rsquo;s beginning.</p>
<p>She tried first the door on her right, knocking tentatively.
When there was no answer she opened the door and looked in.
Transparent cubes of gold, which were sunlight aureoling dust,
slanted between her and the low chain of windows out at the
base of a far-away sloping roof. This was the real attic, all that
Grandam had left of it, after making her own apartment. It
covered more than half the big house, and trunks, discarded
furniture and files of old magazines were stored here, much as
in all attics. There was the smell of dust and of leather, a glimmer
of cobweb curtains. Spaces. Shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>This was, no doubt of it, an attic. And had Ariel expected the
lovely Grandam to live here, in such an environment? To tell
the truth, deep in her heart, though not with her mind, she
had. For Grandam had become to her imagination, even before
seeing her this noon at luncheon, and more vividly since then,
a fairy-like, spiritual entity, twin sister to that other fairy or
spirit (who knows which?) the great-great-great-great-grandmother
who was so loved by the princess in George MacDonald&rsquo;s
true and beautiful allegory, &ldquo;The Princess and the
Goblins.&rdquo; So, with her heart, but perhaps not her eyes, Ariel
sought for her here, dreaming her visible, if one only had eyes
of the seeing kind, in a cloud of invisibility.</p>
<p>Hadn&rsquo;t she seen, a few minutes ago, Grandam driving off
with Glenn in Hugh&rsquo;s roadster? But that didn&rsquo;t matter. It was
the real, the hidden Grandam she might find here&mdash;the one
who would never be out if you needed her.</p>
<p>But after a minute she turned away from dreams. The next
door she knocked at, got no response, and opened, led into an
elevator cage, about as big as a small closet. So that was the
way Grandam and Miss Peters ascended and descended between
the two worlds.</p>
<p>And then her third try brought her to Grandam&rsquo;s apartment.
But no one answered here either, and so Ariel went in and stood
alone, uninvited, but she felt welcomed, in Grandam&rsquo;s own
place.</p>
<p>It was a big, dove-gray room with a darkly oiled floor of old,
wide boards. Four dormer windows reached from the floor to
the raised roof at one side, and two smaller and higher windows
faced the west. On the baby grand piano near the door Ariel
noticed a shallow bowl with hothouse anemones standing up in
it, every flower separate, outlined on the air with glass-like precision,&mdash;mauve,
pink, purple, blue, cream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>A low daybed of ivory-colored wood carved all over with
flower designs was drawn up before one of the dormer windows,
heaped with violet-red and silver cushions. Close to the bed,
within easy arm&rsquo;s reach, there was a bench of the same carved
ivory-white wood, with a few books scattered on it, a crystal
lamp with a wide, pale gold shade, and a glass bowl of hothouse
violets. Several bouquets of violets like the one Hugh
had intended for Ariel but given to Joan must have gone into
this bunch in the glass bowl. Their sweetness was almost palpable.
Scent came falling through the air onto Ariel&rsquo;s eyelids and
onto her lips, as if the very petals of the violets themselves were
wings and filling space.</p>
<p>After the anemones and the violets the wood fire blazing
away in a small grate was next alive, throwing rosy shadows
over black marble tiling, and flickering them up onto tiers of
books whose backs gave the effect of rich tapestry hung from
ceiling to floor on either side of the fireplace. The fire seemed
to Ariel like another cluster of flowers. &ldquo;Roses!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Then she closed the door,&mdash;and in closing it shut herself into
the room. For it had not entered her head to go away and leave
this place until its mistress should return. She was already welcomed
by the flowers, the fire, and the aura of Grandam herself,
which even in her absence seemed as palpable in the atmosphere
here as the scent of the violets. Ariel stood looking at
the door she had closed. On this side it was not a door; it was a
long mirror, crystal clear, and framed with a paneling of faintly
colored flowers and leaves painted on silver. In the mirror, almost
clearer than when looked at directly, was the view from
the windows, the tops of Wild Acres&rsquo; trees, the Hudson, the
purple Palisades, and closer&mdash;startlingly close and clear&mdash;the
carved daybed with its colored cushions, the bowl of violets and,
closer and clearer yet, two upstanding, mauve anemones....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>And there, in that reflected world, Ariel looked for &ldquo;Noon.&rdquo;
For there was the place to find it, in that crystal unearthly
clearness.</p>
<p>She was amazed not to see it at once. Yet she turned about
with confidence only a little dimmed to survey, in order, the
four walls, concrete. But the four walls of Grandam&rsquo;s room
might have been the four walls of a nun&rsquo;s cell, they were so
bare of decoration, washed with their dove gray. There was
only one small picture in an ebony frame which hung at the
side of the window where the daybed stood. It was a drawing,
in pencil, of a man&rsquo;s hands, palms meeting, raised in prayer or
adoration. They were arresting hands, beautiful in austerity,
the hands of a great saint&mdash;or an archangel. They were life
size, and so vivid in their presentation that one might think, by
looking more keenly, to see the arms and shoulders&mdash;the very
head itself&mdash;of the saint or archangel outlined against the dove-gray
wall.</p>
<p>One piece of wall was obscured by a screen, silver silk
stretched on an ebony frame and embroidered with the same
faint flowers as framed the mirror. Ariel crossed to it and
found that it had concealed a door which was standing open.
She went through it and found herself in a dressing room:
Grandam&rsquo;s, of course, because of the scent and feeling of violets,&mdash;and
so <i>still</i>. This was a very small, oblong room, the size of
a big closet. A long, low dressing table surmounted by a mirror
extended the length of one wall, and a window filled the
other. On the table&rsquo;s top crystal-stopped bottles stood in rows.
Ivory and jade and silver boxes clustered everywhere. And
bright liquids glowed in vials. The dressing chair was ivory-colored
like the daybed and the bench in the first room. Over its
low back lay, spread out, a swansdown robe with very wide
sleeves. It seemed to stir and come alive in violet scent as Ariel
bent above it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>And out at the far corner of the table lay a silver crown. No,
it was a wig! A replica of Grandam&rsquo;s curled, short hair. So
that too had been a wig. But Ariel was not repelled. Quite the
contrary. She shivered with a kind of understanding, a delight.
It had come to her that this was Grandam&rsquo;s materialization
room. Or no, it was no room; it was too small and narrow to be
anything but a passageway. It was the passageway through
which Grandam retained her access to the world of time and
space. It was here, sitting in this chair, looking into this mirror,
that she made herself up to become visible, palpable to everyday
touch and sight.</p>
<p>Ariel herself slipped into the chair. Elbows on the table, chin
in her hands, she looked at herself as she appeared in this passageway.
And she saw, for the first time, the Ariel her father
had always seen. Green eyes. Pointed chin. Silver skin. Thin
cheeks, beautifully fine in their drawing. Her heart was beating.
Thud&mdash;thud&mdash;thud.... She turned hurriedly away
from the mirror and the first realization of her peculiar beauty.
It had almost frightened her.</p>
<p>Out of the dressing room, and several times larger, opened
the bathroom. It was green like a pool in deep woods. The door
beyond was closed. Ariel knocked. A voice said &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ariel opened the door in response to the voice which had
startled her, for she had begun to think herself very much alone
up here in Grandam&rsquo;s &ldquo;attic,&rdquo; Miss Peters turned about from a
desk where she had been writing a letter and stared at Ariel as
at a ghost. And Ariel stared back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Clare! It is Miss Clare, isn&rsquo;t it? Where did you
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for&mdash;&rdquo; No, she could not say &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;!...
She had not betrayed her expectations and disappointments to
any one else at Wild Acres and she was not going to begin with
Miss Peters. So she finished, after a perceptible pause&mdash;&ldquo;I was
looking for something. But it isn&rsquo;t here. I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t up
here at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of your own?&rdquo; But Miss Peters colored as she
asked it. She hadn&rsquo;t meant to be insulting to this guest of the
Weymans about whom she knew nothing at all and had heard
nothing,&mdash;since she was not on gossiping terms with the two
servants. But &ldquo;the old lady&rdquo; was away, out driving with Glenn.
It was very odd of Miss Clare, to say the least, to come prowling
through the rooms in her absence. No one, not even Miss Anne
and the two young men and their mother, ever came into the
apartment uninvited.</p>
<p>Ariel realized Miss Peters&rsquo; perturbation. She said &ldquo;No. It isn&rsquo;t
mine, the thing I hoped to find. And anyway, it&rsquo;s not up here at
all. It isn&rsquo;t anywhere at Wild Acres. If it were at Wild Acres it
<i>would</i> be here, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can help you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel shook her head. &ldquo;No, thanks. I&rsquo;ll just go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may use my door, then. You must have come through
Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s whole apartment. This goes into the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Peters was moving toward her door, expecting Ariel to
take the hint. But Ariel was too abstracted to realize. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
back the way I came,&rdquo; she murmured. And Miss Peters knew
nothing to do about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>But back in Grandam&rsquo;s big room she decided to wait quietly
up there for Grandam&rsquo;s return from her outing. She was drawn
to the daybed, with its wide view across woodlands to the
Palisades. She sat down on the edge of the bed and absently
gathered a scarf which was lying there up into her beauty-loving
fingers. After a minute, she rose to her knees on the bed and
wrapped the scarf about her. It was a silver wing, a silver cloud
which draped her. One could dance in a scarf like this, even in
the house. She wished that Persis and Nicky were here. She
would dance for them, if they were, over the dark floor; she
would feel that she was dancing, really, out in the golden snowy
air, because of the magic of this scarf of Grandam&rsquo;s. She began
to hum,&mdash;low humming, with no tune in it. And she did not
hear the door from the hall open and the quick step that followed.
But she heard Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s voice when it came. Yet
she did not start. One does not start out of such quiet happiness
as had come to Ariel up here in Grandam&rsquo;s environment. She
looked up quietly into Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s astounded face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear! Has Mrs. Weyman returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Grandam is motoring with Glenn.&rdquo; But such literalness
was childish and Ariel knew it even as she spoke.</p>
<p>She hurried on, suddenly embarrassed. &ldquo;I just came up to
look for something. But it isn&rsquo;t here. Then&mdash;the view&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the scarf! Really, Ariel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she would. More than most people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel unwound herself from the lovely scarf. And in spite of
its gossamer delicacy and the tough texture of her own green
jersey frock, she felt that in coming out of the scarf she was
coming out of a sure protection into a kind of nakedness. She
folded the scarf very carefully, very softly, and laid it on a pillow.
As she did this she murmured, &ldquo;If it had been Grandam
who came in just now instead of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman laughed, not unkindly. &ldquo;My dear girl! If she
only <i>had</i> come in! Found you kneeling on her precious bed,
dressing up in her own precious scarfs! You&rsquo;d have felt like&mdash;about
two cents. It&rsquo;s a gift she has. You&rsquo;re lucky it was I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she grew serious. &ldquo;Ariel, I don&rsquo;t want to offend you or
hurt your feelings. I know things must be very strange and difficult
for you these days. But there are a few very simple things I
can help you with, I think. &lsquo;Grandam,&rsquo; for instance. Just the family
call my mother-in-law that. It&rsquo;s a pet name made up by the
children when they were little, you see. You had better call her
&lsquo;Mrs. Weyman.&rsquo; And then, to simplify things, you may call me
&lsquo;Mrs. John.&rsquo; People do, quite often, when there&rsquo;s need to distinguish.
And let&rsquo;s both run along now before she appears. She&rsquo;d
be no more charmed with finding me here than you, even if I
did come up with <i>this</i> scarf which Miss Peters neglected to
bring. And they&rsquo;ll be back any minute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span></h2>
<p>Grandam did not come down to dinner that night.
But Mrs. Weyman said that she rarely did appear for two meals
in the same day, even when she was feeling her best. Ariel suspected
that Mrs. Weyman, in emphasizing this point, was indirectly
intending to reassure her and make her feel that
Grandam&rsquo;s absence had nothing to do with her own visit uninvited
to the attic apartment.</p>
<p>They gathered in the library after dinner. Glenn and Ariel
were at one end of the divan in front of the fire engaged in setting
up the chessmen. Anne and Prescott Enderly were at the
other end, waiting for Mrs. Nevin, who was taking them, that
evening, to a dance at the house of friends of hers in Scarsdale.
Mrs. Weyman occupied a low chair near by, and she was smoking
an after-dinner cigarette.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Enderly looked both handsome and distinguished in his evening
clothes. &ldquo;Much more the accredited novelist than the college
boy,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Weyman, looking at him through the
spiraling smoke of her cigarette, which was mostly held in her
fingers and very rarely in her lips, since she smoked only to put
other smokers at their ease, including her daughter Anne,&mdash;and
to keep young. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s changed since he came. Seems more
manly, somehow. Firmer. And exhilarated about something
too. I wonder, is it Joan? That she&rsquo;s almost ten years older
wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily make any difference. Probably she&rsquo;s the
first woman of the world he has ever met,&mdash;at any rate seen
so much of. She would be a revelation, a dream come true, to a
young man of his background.&rdquo; For Enderly&rsquo;s family was
totally undistinguished socially. Glenn had told his mother this,
and added that Enderly boasted of the fact, and was more glad
than otherwise not to belong to the &ldquo;bloated bourgeoisie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, looking rather keenly at the young man through the
smoke spiraling up through her fingers, Mrs. Weyman exclaimed
with assumed casualness, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather sweet of Mrs.
Nevin to be so nice to you young things! Having you to meet
Michael Schwankovsky this afternoon and all! But I suppose,
Prescott, you have unclassed yourself as a young thing by
having produced &lsquo;Stephen&rsquo;s Fall&rsquo; and got famous. Glenn and
Anne, of course, are merely being included along with you.
Don&rsquo;t you find her very charming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enderly was holding Anne&rsquo;s hand, for all the decorum of their
appearance, as it lay between them on the divan, under a fold of
her outspread skirt. &ldquo;Oh, very charming,&rdquo; he answered, with
casualness as assumed as his hostess&rsquo;. &ldquo;Beauty, brains and magnetism,
all working together, make a very high-powered charm.
And she must have used the full force of it on her bootlegger.
We don&rsquo;t get the chance to buy that quality from ours, do we,
Glenn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman crushed out her cigarette on a tray at her elbow.
For the first time she felt definitely jarred by Enderly&rsquo;s
personality. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite wrong,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Anything
that Mrs. Nevin serves would be legal. Her cellar was stocked
by her husband before the war, and it will last her a lifetime,
the way she uses it. She doesn&rsquo;t drink and give drinking parties
as some society women do. She entertains with the same dignity
and reasonableness that all of our kind of people did before
prohibition. It&rsquo;s the same with us. Anything you are served here
is legal.&rdquo; It was important for even a famous novelist to be
aware of impeccability, when he was being entertained by it.</p>
<p>Enderly&rsquo;s fingers had closed about Anne&rsquo;s wrist, stifling her
heart, while her mother took such pains with his social education.
But he answered with disarming candor, &ldquo;Oh, I took that
quite for granted, about you, I mean. But I couldn&rsquo;t know
about Mrs. Nevin, could I? So many different sorts of people
know her, or claim to, and boast of being entertained at Holly!
And although she&rsquo;s obviously a lady, she&rsquo;s even more obviously
a person of temperament, genius. I hadn&rsquo;t associated her with
Puritanism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean you to! Mrs. Nevin is as far removed from
anything Puritanical or priggish as I am. But she has <i>character</i>.
Aristocracy, if you like. Self-respecting people must draw the
line somewhere, even to-day. But they needn&rsquo;t be bigoted. Look
at me. I let Anne smoke. I even smoke with her. But that sort
of tolerance doesn&rsquo;t change one&rsquo;s fundamental principles. In
things that really matter, our kind of people are not changed at
all. We keep our standards for ourselves and our associates pretty
definite. And Mrs. Nevin is one of us, very much so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Glenn had just captured Ariel&rsquo;s queen, but for all that his
smile as he barged into the conversation at this point was a
sardonic smile. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you got Mother doped out for yourself,
Scribbler?&rdquo; he asked his friend. &ldquo;Pity to make her do it for you!
Bad commentary on your analytical powers. Couldn&rsquo;t you see,
at first sight, that she is one of those simple souls who believe
that this jazz-ridden world is as sound at bottom, possibly
sounder, than the lost world of the Good Queen Vic? It has
invented virtues, not lost them. Who ever heard of frankness,
honesty, hatred of shams before our somber decade? We&rsquo;re less
prudish, of course, but all the more wholesome for precisely that
reason. And though somewhat obscured by the camouflage of
&lsquo;petting,&rsquo; purity still reigns supreme in girlish hearts, and honor
in manly breasts. At least in the best families&mdash;like ours. Your
own novel is only an example, Prescott. Its obscenity is healthy
obscenity. By showing up the visible and ugly, you suggest all
the more vividly the lovely idealism lurking under it all, invisible.
Didn&rsquo;t Stephen, in the end, after his diverting but possibly
sordid passional experiences, fall in love, in the last chapters,
with a nice girl? He seduced her, of course, but it woke
her stupid parents up to the facts of&mdash;er&mdash;<i>life</i>. It&rsquo;s a very
idealistic book. Even the old folks got saved. They saw how
narrow they&rsquo;d been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, chuck it, Glenn! I&rsquo;m in perfect sympathy with your
mother. And I believe&mdash;in fact, I believe it passionately&mdash;that
she is right. What is moderation and self-control but aristocracy?
Our Bohemian pose is too cheap, too easy. What do you
think, Anne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Anne thought no one but Enderly discovered, however,
for it was conveyed to him very simply by the throbbing of a
pulse in a delicate, blue-veined wrist.</p>
<p>At that moment Miss Peters surprisingly made an appearance
in the library door. &ldquo;Mrs. Weyman Senior would be
charmed if Miss Clare would care to come up to her for a little
while this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel sprang from the divan. &ldquo;Oh, do you mind, Glenn? I
do want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; Glenn exclaimed. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t matter. The
Queen has sent her command. And the elevator waits without.
I say! I thought you enjoyed chess, though!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Mrs. Weyman beckoned Ariel to her side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Miss
Peters has told Grandam about&mdash;our being in the apartment
this afternoon, and that is why she has sent for you. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Don&rsquo;t do anything to excite her unnecessarily, will you, and
come away as soon as you can.&rdquo; Then, turning to Miss Peters,
who stood waiting to escort Ariel to the elevator, she asked,
&ldquo;How is Mrs. Weyman to-night? I hope the drive didn&rsquo;t tire
her too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a little tired. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the drive.&rdquo; Miss
Peters was looking curiously at Ariel. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll keep
Miss Clare long. She ought to be in bed this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator was waiting for them at the end of the back hall.
Miss Peters ran it very nonchalantly by a mere touching of buttons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s the way it works? Next time I can take myself
up,&rdquo; Ariel said, as they stepped out into the attic hall. Miss
Peters, meticulously closing the sliding door of the cage, remarked,
&ldquo;Oh, the family never use the elevator. Mrs. Weyman
has heart disease, you know, and Mr. Hugh put it in for her.
Then it&rsquo;s a convenience in carrying trays up and down, of course.
I couldn&rsquo;t take care of Mrs. Weyman if I had to climb two
flights of stairs each meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attic hall, by night, was unromantically lighted by ordinary
electric-light bulbs. Ariel regretted the afternoon&rsquo;s mysterious
twilight. But when Miss Peters had opened Grandam&rsquo;s
door, announced Ariel, and gone on her way, leaving them
alone together, all the romance of the afternoon poured back,
with Grandam added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Curtains of dim flower pattern were drawn across the windows.
But they did not give the effect of shutting in the room.
They were caressing, as night&rsquo;s own starry curtains, and they
brought distance near. Tall wax candles glimmered their light
down on the piano, over the ivory keys and the glossy rosewood,
and the dish with the anemones. But the anemones themselves
stood up dark in the dusk, their colors lost. At the edge
of the area of light shed by the crystal lamp on the bench, across
the room, lay Grandam, her head elevated, among her pillows.
She was wearing the silver scarf in which Ariel had been discovered
by Mrs. Weyman.</p>
<p>A chair was drawn up conveniently near to the daybed in
preparation for Miss Clare&rsquo;s visit. But Ariel ignored it, or perhaps
did not see it. She went straight to the daybed and sat down
on the edge of that, face to face with Grandam.</p>
<p>Grandam did not waste words. &ldquo;Miss Peters says you were
up here this afternoon, Ariel, looking for something in my
apartment. I have the liveliest curiosity to know what it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo; the painting Hugh bought of my
father. I can&rsquo;t find where they&rsquo;ve hung it. I couldn&rsquo;t ask Hugh,
since Father himself wouldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;and anyway, he went away
the very first day. But after you came to lunch I thought Hugh
must have given it to you,&mdash;that it would be here. But it isn&rsquo;t
here. Can you tell me where it is? I don&rsquo;t mind asking you.
Father wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pity woke in Grandam&rsquo;s face. Things she had at different
times heard of Ariel and her father and this picture of Hugh&rsquo;s
all suddenly fitted themselves together into a human pattern.
She knew a great deal, all at once. She was silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Ariel, during the silence, noticed that Grandam was not
wearing her wig. This was her own hair, cut short, clipping
her small head like a knight&rsquo;s helmet. It was even lovelier than
the wig, Ariel thought. What <i>was</i> Grandam? She was not an
old lady with heart disease. She was not a grande dame of a
civilization outworn. She was not even Ariel&rsquo;s great-great-great-great-grandmother.
Whatever she was, she was a friend of
Ariel&rsquo;s and would have been even more a friend of her father&rsquo;s,
if he had only known her.</p>
<p>Grandam at last said, &ldquo;I think I must have been away from
Wild Acres, abroad, when Hugh came back with that picture.
And I never have seen it. But very recently, since you came, in
fact, Hortense has mentioned it to me, told me where it is. You
shall have it to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was on her feet. &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Wait. Let&rsquo;s talk a few minutes first. Sit down again, my
dear. Why are you so&mdash;so wild to see this picture? Didn&rsquo;t you
bring any other of your father&rsquo;s pictures with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel sat down again on the edge of the bed. Now that
Grandam had promised her a sight of &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; she could wait
patiently forever, so long as she waited here with Grandam.
&ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t bring a single canvas,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You see,
they are all quite big. But I am keeping out five for myself. Not
letting them be sold&mdash;although they will be in the exhibition,
of course. Father thought &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; the very best of them all. And
seeing it again now,&mdash;well, it will be like going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can understand that. But you look as though you were
seeing a vision, Ariel. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was looking at the picture in the ebony frame beyond
Grandam&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Those hands,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They make me
think of Father&rsquo;s to-night, though they didn&rsquo;t this afternoon
when I was up here. And they aren&rsquo;t like his really. Father&rsquo;s
hands aren&rsquo;t so long, and the fingers aren&rsquo;t nearly so pointed.
Are those an angel&rsquo;s hands? Or a saint&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Grandam&rsquo;s expression was veiled. Yet it was not a secretive
look that came into her features, making them enigmatical; it
was an illuminative glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very fine artist drew those hands,&rdquo; she said. But her voice
was concealing as much as was her face, and Ariel knew it. &ldquo;He
is dead now. Piccoli. An Italian. And he had an earthly model,
not an angel. At least he thought so, I suppose. The hands themselves&mdash;are
the hands of a friend of mine. He, too, is dead....
How is it with you here at Wild Acres, Ariel? Are you lonely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel bent quickly forward and picking up an end of Grandam&rsquo;s
silver scarf, kissed it. &ldquo;I am not lonely now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Who could be! And I&rsquo;m never really lonely in the woods.&rdquo;
Then she told Grandam about sensing violets behind the snow
that first day at Wild Acres and how she had found Persis and
Nicky in the woods and danced her happiness for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at lunch you were saying you had no talent. What about
dancing for a profession, Ariel? Have you thought of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel shook her head. &ldquo;My dancing is like those hands there
in their adoring. Adoring, and dancing, and loving,&mdash;they
aren&rsquo;t professions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, dancing can be as much a conscious and cultivated art
as painting. Seriously, Ariel, hadn&rsquo;t this occurred to you? Or to
your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But, then, I never saw a real dancer. Father has told
me about Isadora Duncan and her wonderful dancing. And
there&rsquo;s Ruth St. Denis, too! But he liked Isadora better.&rdquo; She
went on then to tell Grandam how her father had put her,
dancing, into all of his pictures. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; too,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re not pictures of me, you understand. Not portraits.
You do understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, they&rsquo;re not pictures of you; they are snatches
at the idea of you. But you&rsquo;ve come just in the nick of time,
Ariel. I might have got away, with you in the house, and never
known you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going away!&rdquo; Ariel&rsquo;s fingers closed again on the
scarf, as if to clutch Grandam back. &ldquo;Where? How soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die. Quite soon, the doctors think. But you got
here first. And now I can be a messenger to your father from
you. You will bring us together, perhaps. Do you think we
shall get along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was not grave. She was merry. Oh, this was no old lady
with dangerous heart disease, but a vibrant, swift-footed friend
whom she was holding back from departure with force, by this
piece of clutched drapery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Grandam told her, &ldquo;when I was a little girl
and taken on train journeys, I&rsquo;d look out of the windows at
other children playing in dooryards, walking along roads, and
sitting on fences waving at my train. And I&rsquo;d wonder how they
could bear being left behind, not being in a train. Do all children
in trains feel that way, looking out of coach windows? I
suspect they do. Well, Ariel, I&rsquo;m in the same case now. I&rsquo;m on
the train, actually off, on a journey, and all the rest of you are
like those other children. The nearest you can come to my adventure
is to sit on the country fences and wave me past. And
it&rsquo;s more glorious than exciting because at the end of this journey
there will be people I love and haven&rsquo;t seen for almost a
life-time. Those hands&mdash;these that you asked about, Ariel&mdash;will
be there, I believe, to open the coach door.... Do you wonder
that I pity all you children, left behind, out of the journey?
But not you, Ariel! You aren&rsquo;t left. You are more like a darting
swallow at the train window, keeping up for a little way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ariel cried. &ldquo;Put out your wrist, Grandam! I&rsquo;ll light
on it. I&rsquo;ll stay till the wind blows me off!&rdquo; Then they smiled at
each other and during the instant of the smile their friendship
mellowed as though the instant had been an entire life-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re forgetting about &lsquo;Noon,&rsquo;&rdquo; Grandam reminded
Ariel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you now to look for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for it? But don&rsquo;t you know where it is? I thought you
said you knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the attic across the hall. It mayn&rsquo;t be just in plain
sight, though. But we&rsquo;ll find it and bring it in here and hang
it above the mantel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the attic! But why?&rdquo; Ariel could not take it in for a minute.
But strangely, her body was quicker than her brain to react.
Her heart had started an angry pounding and her fingers
were curling into her palms, hard, the nails biting into the flesh.
Ariel wondered at her fingers and at her heart.</p>
<p>She had followed Grandam across the floor toward the hall
door. But Grandam halted by the piano and leaned a hand on
it, suddenly supporting herself. &ldquo;Wait, Ariel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try to explain it to you a little. Hugh put &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; in the attic
because he didn&rsquo;t want it around where he could see it. But it
isn&rsquo;t the insult to the painting and to your father that it seems.
I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t. It is something different altogether. For the
attic, in this case, isn&rsquo;t the attic at all....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ariel was not to be betrayed into thinking that the attic
was the haunted, magical home of the invisible great-great-great-great-grandmother
which she had almost imagined it on looking
in there this afternoon. Her nails were biting into her palms,
and her mouth was dry. What did Grandam mean, saying the
attic was not an attic?</p>
<p>Grandam was looking down at the anemones. She had
stopped looking at Ariel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;The attic isn&rsquo;t an attic&mdash;because it is Hugh&rsquo;s subconscious
mind. That&rsquo;s what modern psychology, anyway, calls the place
where we chuck away the memories that hurt us. And no more
than the attic out there is an attic, is &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; a painting. It was a
painting when Hugh bought it, and thought it so beautiful.
But Hugh was in love. And when one is a lover, every
&aelig;sthetic joy actually hurts until it can be passed on to the beloved.
To share it would be even more relieving, of course. But
in this case there was no hope of Hugh&rsquo;s sharing anything very
much with Mrs. Nevin. Her husband was still living and Joan
had chosen him in preference to Hugh, anyway. No. Whatever
he could possess of beauty he must give her outright, not even
think of sharing with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam touched the glassy petal of an anemone, so lightly
that its delicate nerves did not feel a tremor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he showed &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; to Joan without first telling her that
it was to belong to her, because he wanted to tantalize her a
little&mdash;and enjoy with her the moment of surprise when he
thrust &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; into her hands, to keep. But he never got that
far, for Joan merely laughed at the painting, and the artist, and
laughed at all the Bermuda episode. She wanted to be the
source of all his joys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the instant of that laugh &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; stopped being a
painting to Hugh. It became the symbol of his love,&mdash;sneered
at, denied. So he tossed it into the attic and shut the door on
it. Forgot it. A very wholesome proceeding in spite of the
psychoanalysts.... But whether this explanation, which, to
be honest, is not founded on knowledge but merely surmise,
really <i>is</i> an explanation or not needn&rsquo;t matter to you, I hope.
You&rsquo;ll be magnanimous.... If one can&rsquo;t be magnanimous,
one had better be chucked into the attic oneself. I can state
that as a fact. No surmise about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Ariel, too, was looking at the anemone. She addressed it,
rather than Grandam, but to her they were one,&mdash;the glassy,
heavenly still flower, and the voice counseling magnanimity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go now and get that&mdash;love, hidden in the attic,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Find it. Dust it. Nobody can stop me. You
mustn&rsquo;t come, Grandam. You look very tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam was more tired than she had known, and glad to
be forced, very nearly carried, over to her daybed by Ariel. She
could well afford to rest now. Ariel was all right.</p>
<p>It took Ariel some long minutes in the cold barnlike place,
robbed by Grandam&rsquo;s analogy of mystery and charm, to find
&ldquo;Noon.&rdquo; But at last she hauled it out from behind a wall of discarded
mattresses, a rather large and heavy unframed canvas,
festooned with dusty cobwebs. Not minding at all the havoc it
wreaked on her wispy green evening frock, she brought it in to
Grandam&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn away your face,&rdquo; she called from the door. &ldquo;I want to
dust it before you look and I&rsquo;ll put it up on the mantel with the
candles around it. It&rsquo;ll be better in daylight, of course, but even
candlelight will give you some idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam turned her face obediently but held out the silver
shawl toward Ariel. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a duster,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just the
thing for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without objections or even hesitation, Ariel used that live,
lovely belonging of Grandam&rsquo;s to dust the cobwebs and the dirt
from the face of &ldquo;Noon.&rdquo; But she knew perfectly what it was
she was doing. And Grandam knew that she knew. For the
scarf was a rare and unreplaceable thing. Ariel&rsquo;s tongue and
lips were dry as the dust on the picture over which she worked
and her heart beat heavily, like the waves on her home beach
after a storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>As she lifted the canvas up to position on the fireplace mantel
and then brought candles from the piano to set either side of
it, Grandam, with her face conscientiously turned away, was
saying, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be disappointed, Ariel, if I don&rsquo;t find
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo; so wonderful as Hugh and you and your father think
it. I&rsquo;m no judge of painting. Know next to nothing about it. It
will be merely a matter of personal taste with me, and of no
account whatever as criticism. But then no individual&rsquo;s word
can make a final judgment. Not Joan&rsquo;s certainly. Not even
Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s. Not yours or mine, or your father&rsquo;s.
Least of all your father&rsquo;s, Ariel. No one knows anything about
his own creative work&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s good or bad&mdash;any more
than the soul knows its own state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ariel scarcely heard her or cared to hear her. The picture
was placed. She moved back into the middle of the room, and
looked. <i>And looked.</i></p>
<p>Home.... She had come home! Grandam&rsquo;s room was a
dove-gray wave on which she had been tossed up onto her and
her father&rsquo;s own beach, and she stood now in the hollow where
her father&rsquo;s easel had stood the morning that Hugh interrupted
the painting of the masterpiece.... She had come home. <i>And
her Father was not far off.</i> Her heart had stopped thudding.
The waves on the beach were stilled in the noon heat. Tears
overflowed onto her cold cheeks with grateful warmth. She
tasted salt on her lips,&mdash;and thought it sea spray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>But now that she was blind, Grandam was seeing. Grandam,
looking through white sunlight, saw an edge of curling wave,
a white beach, rocks where the sunlight broke into purple
pieces, and in the air just above the rocks, Ariel dancing. It was
the Ariel of five years ago, and still it was the same Ariel, because
the artist&rsquo;s genius had caught her as she would be always,
through eternity. It was her essence he had caught there, as
surely as her grace. And he had got the beach in the same way,&mdash;the
essence of it.</p>
<p>Grandam, in spite of the ignorance she had claimed for herself,
knew perfectly well that anything which could stop her
breath, as this painting did, and then make her life go on with a
new tide of richness and meaning in its flow, as this picture did
too, was&mdash;<i>good</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span></h2>
<p>Hugh, returning from his five days&rsquo; sojourn in Chicago,
was met by the thrum of jazz as he turned into Wild Acres
avenue. The radio would hardly be so noisy at this distance from
the house, and so he realized that there was an orchestra of several
pieces at work, and a party forward. Well, of course, it was
the last night of &ldquo;Spring vacation.&rdquo; Stupid not to have remembered
the probability of festivities under the circumstances.
As he came nearer, the house blazed out at him through
bare trees almost like a bonfire, it was so brilliantly lighted from
top to bottom.</p>
<p>He would get past the library and drawing-room doors if he
could, without being seen, run up to Grandam for as long a
visit as she wanted, and then, leaving a note on his mother&rsquo;s
pillow to let her know that he had returned, get to bed after
snatching a bite in the pantry. But this simple plan evaporated
when, in the act of sliding past the drawing-room door, his eyes
calamitously met Joan Nevin&rsquo;s. She was dancing with Prescott
Enderly on the edge of the wild young mob in there&mdash;Joan!
So it wasn&rsquo;t a children&rsquo;s party, after all. But of course it couldn&rsquo;t
be, quite, with Prescott Enderly the guest of honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Hugh went up the stairs two at a time. Joan&rsquo;s eyes had given
him an invitation, or rather a command. He smiled to himself
as he rushed into evening togs. Usually Joan was more subtle
in what she allowed to show in her face. Was the famous Enderly
boring her? Didn&rsquo;t he quite come up to his own Stephen
as an attraction? It was plainly rescue, anyway, Joan needed;
otherwise she would never have shown such na&iuml;ve joy at the
sight of himself.</p>
<p>He jerked his tie into trim little wings, bent and gave himself
one keen glance of survey in the mirror of his too low bureau,
and was out in the upper hall. But he did not run down to the
party and Joan immediately. He had never come home from a
journey in his life, when his grandmother was at Wild Acres,
without &ldquo;dropping up&rdquo; to say a hail to her. But he congratulated
himself for his self-discipline to-night as he ran up a flight of
stairs instead of running down a flight.</p>
<p>Grandam closed a book as if that were the end of that, when
he entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hugh! You&rsquo;re welcome. For I&rsquo;ve as much to tell you
this time as you can possibly have to tell me. And I&rsquo;m going to
have first turn. No, not the edge of my bed, <i>please</i>, Hugh! How
many times have I got to tell you I simply won&rsquo;t have it? It
spoils the mattress. Ariel&rsquo;s the only one I&rsquo;ll allow. She can&rsquo;t
weigh enough to really hurt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ariel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ariel. Who else? Why did you keep her hidden, Hugh?
From me, I mean. It&rsquo;s Ariel I want to talk about, as I haven&rsquo;t
wanted to talk,&mdash;for years!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>As Grandam repeated the name, it came to Hugh that Ariel,
while hardly in his mind concretely at all during the week of
his absence, had never actually been very far away from it. She
had, to his mental preoccupations, something of the relation she
had to the central theme of her father&rsquo;s paintings. She did not
get mixed up with the works, but she was there all the same,
hovering on the edges,&mdash;definite and vital. A girl with March
sunshine squinting her green eyes into Chinesy slits under the
brim of a green hat. A girl with a friendly, pointed-cornered
mouth. A girl in a white coat, looking like a fairy-tale princess...,
too.</p>
<p>As it happened, the visit to Grandam prolonged itself rather
unreasonably. Hugh realized that he had stayed longer than he
had meant to or perhaps than he should, considering Joan&rsquo;s
optical invitation to the dance. But he did not take out his watch
as he finally went down, and so he was not aware that more
than an hour had flown away, while he and Grandam talked of
Ariel.</p>
<p>And then, at the head of the second flight of stairs he was
halted by a laugh, which reached him, like a finger of light,
through the blare of the jazz. It came from the wing where the
guest rooms were. Curiosity drew him in that direction a few
steps. Then he heard it again. Two of the doors in the guest
wing were shut, but one stood open upon darkness. That was
the room Ariel was occupying. As he paused, puzzled by this
strange phenomenon of a girl laughing to herself in the dark,
Glenn&rsquo;s voice impinged on the laugh. Just a word or two, and
then Glenn, too, laughed. Hugh strode to the door.</p>
<p>The light from the hall penetrated the room enough to show
him his brother lying on his elbow across the foot of Ariel&rsquo;s
bed, and the dim figure of Ariel herself, sitting up against the
pillows, the eiderdown drawn up to her chin like a tent. The
windows were open and the little room was fresh with snowy
airiness. Hugh went in. &ldquo;I say, Glenn, what are you doing
here?&rdquo; He spoke evenly enough but his voice was displeased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! You back?&rdquo; Glenn leaned higher on his elbow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
here entertaining Ariel. You asked me to look out for her when
I put you on your train, and I&rsquo;ve been doing my duty ever since.
You ought to be gratified to find me at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be late. You&rsquo;d better be at your dance, hadn&rsquo;t you?
And isn&rsquo;t this getting the house cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh air is the best thing that could happen to this house,&rdquo;
Glenn responded cryptically. &ldquo;But if you think Joan may catch
cold, shut the door. We don&rsquo;t mind, do we Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to talk to Ariel myself, since she&rsquo;s awake. And
you do belong down at your own party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn got up. &ldquo;Oh, I know I&rsquo;m probably spoiling the party
for poor Joan, absenting myself for so long. I&rsquo;ll go do my duty
by <i>her</i>, now that you&rsquo;ve relieved me of Ariel. Glad you&rsquo;re back,
Hugh. Good night, Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn&rsquo;s mockery affected Hugh hardly at all. For the minute
he was intent on the things that he must say to Ariel,&mdash;at once,
now, to-night, since it had so chanced that he was seeing her
to-night. &ldquo;<i>May</i> I stay a few minutes?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t
sleepy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed a chair within a little distance of the bed. Hugh&rsquo;s
generation, no more than Glenn&rsquo;s, was patterned to a conventional
idea of manners, but Hugh himself as an individual had
never quite attained the modern casualness. Still, Ariel, tented
to her chin in the eiderdown, her face a mere blur in the starry
light, was not exactly a figure to inspire self-consciousness in
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been talking with Grandam,&rdquo; he plunged at once
into what was on his mind. &ldquo;And I say, Ariel, I am more sorry
than I can tell about &lsquo;Noon.&rsquo; Why I didn&rsquo;t have it out, at least,
before you got here, I can&rsquo;t see now. Grandam considers herself
lucky to have acquired it for her mantel now. But she&rsquo;ll lend it
to the exhibition, of course. I&rsquo;ll get in touch with Charlie Frye
about that the first minute we hear from him. And afterwards
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo; is to be yours. It doesn&rsquo;t belong to me after the way I&rsquo;ve
treated it, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Grandam dies&rdquo;&mdash;Ariel said the word without fear&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to buy &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; from you, Hugh Weyman. You must
let her keep it till then. I&rsquo;ve already told her. She understands,
and she&rsquo;s going to help me so that I <i>can</i> buy it. She knows
about a job she thinks I can get. The minute I begin to earn, I
shall begin to save&mdash;toward &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; and toward my lovely white
coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ariel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Probably you think it will take me forever. But it won&rsquo;t.
It&rsquo;s quite a good job, Grandam says. I&rsquo;m not counting on the exhibition
any more, do you see! I know that Mrs. Nevin has told
you that nothing will come of it. And Grandam herself says
that Father may have been the greatest of geniuses, but that
that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the world&rsquo;s going to admit it. It
may take hundreds of years, she says&mdash;and it may take forever&mdash;which
means never, of course. But Father was (you must
believe me&mdash;Grandam does) absolutely certain that rich people
with taste like Mrs. Nevin and Michael Schwankovsky had
only to see the exhibition and they would be glad to pay quite
big prices for the pictures. And I&rsquo;d be then absolutely independent.
He did not dream what an unreasonable thing he was
doing&mdash;throwing me onto you and your family, when you
were strangers, not even relations, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Hugh leaned toward her. He found her shoulders through the
eiderdown and shook her, not entirely playfully. &ldquo;We are not
strangers. Your father was my friend. I loved him. I love him
now. There will never be anything like that again for me. It
is only other things&mdash;life itself&mdash;that made me blunder so
with him, in not writing, or going back all these years, and in
my neglect of you since you&rsquo;ve been here at Wild Acres. There&rsquo;s
something that has blinded me, mixed me up. You wouldn&rsquo;t
understand. Grandam&rsquo;s the only person in the world who could
understand, and I don&rsquo;t bother her with it. She thinks I&rsquo;ve acted
like a fool toward you and toward your father. But all the same,
she knows that I loved your father, and that <i>I cherish you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped. And Ariel kept still. After a while he went on
more calmly, &ldquo;So, my dear, we&rsquo;ll just wait and see what comes of
the exhibition. If nothing comes of it, and there is that possibility,
I&rsquo;m afraid, then we will put our heads together, yours
and Grandam&rsquo;s and mine, and find some way to make you independent,
for that is, of course, what you would want. But the
coat will remain my gift to you. Why, Ariel, I have had such
fun just thinking about that coat, and you in it! Even if you
would <i>rather have had violets</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it cost several hundreds of dollars. It must have. And
Anne&rsquo;s wearing quite a shabby squirrel-fur. Two years old.
And she did love mine so, the minute she saw it. She kept on admiring
it every day until I had to tell her you had given it to
me! She was terribly surprised. Don&rsquo;t you see how it was really
unkind of you&mdash;to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not thought of the coat in terms of money until now.
In dressing Ariel up in it he had returned to a forgotten freedom,&mdash;to
a state where values were somehow different from
his present values. But when had they shifted? And was the
shift a poor or a good thing? Ariel might be right, and he might
have taken a flight into pure selfishness, not into the free air
he had imagined, in spending hundreds of dollars on a beautiful
garment for his friend&rsquo;s daughter without due consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>But he said, &ldquo;Well, whatever you think and say, and whatever
is true or not true, about that pretty coat and &lsquo;Noon&rsquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
keep them both, now that I&rsquo;ve given them to you, and
if you ever mention money again to me, I&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re not
nice enough to be your father&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; He got up and went
to the windows. The curtains had blown from their ties and he
fastened them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to the dance now,&rdquo; he said. But he came
back and stood for a minute looking at her. With the curtains
back he could see her plainer. He said, more gently, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not going to quarrel, are we? Grandam promised me you&rsquo;d be
magnanimous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Joan was sitting in the lower hall near the front door, wrapped
in her opera cape, while Prescott Enderly knelt at her feet,
buckling on her opera boots. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going yet. I thought
you&rsquo;d promised me a dance,&rdquo; Hugh protested, running down
the last few stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had. But you didn&rsquo;t come for it. It&rsquo;s not much fun
being the only old woman at a dance. So I&rsquo;m retreating in good
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enderly chuckled. &ldquo;Old woman! She&rsquo;s going in the interests
of peace, let me tell you. Have you been able to keep the same
partner for half a minute, to-night, Mrs. Nevin? This cutting-in
business is an abomination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Joan, I had to dress before I could appear. Then I
ran up to speak to Grandam. She was expecting me home tonight,
and she&rsquo;d be asleep later, when the party was over. I may
take these off, mayn&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; Hugh was down beside Enderly, his
fingers on a buckle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Joan drew back her foot. &ldquo;Glenn seemed to have an idea it
was Miss Clare you had run to speak to. Grandam is a rival I
could have credited. But Ariel&mdash;rather surprises me. Thanks,
Prescott. That last buckle doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s always a nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was &ldquo;Prescott&rdquo; already with Joan. Hugh mentally congratulated
the novelist on his quick work, for Joan was notoriously
deliberate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t your Ariel down dancing, Hugh?&rdquo; she inquired.
&ldquo;Oh, I forgot. Her father, I suppose. Well, I&rsquo;m off. Good night.&rdquo;
She was standing, giving him her hand, smiling at him mockingly.
&ldquo;Was your trip successful? Did you see anything of my
friends, the Weavers? Or Patricia Wilcox, by any chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enderly was at the door to open it, and Joan was only asking
Hugh these questions to soften the immediate departure she
intended. But Hugh was not put off so lightly. &ldquo;If you will go,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;m going with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enderly, obedient to Joan&rsquo;s slightest motion, opened the door,
and the three of them moved out into the portico. Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s
limousine was drawn up at the foot of the steps. Her chauffeur
waited, dark against the lighted interior of the car, an erect
figure, almost Egyptian in passivity, until Joan started down the
steps, a man at either shoulder. Then he sprang down to stand
at attention at the limousine door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming with you,&rdquo; Hugh repeated as the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sorry, Hugh, really. But I&rsquo;m in a hurry, and you
haven&rsquo;t an overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t need more coddling than an
orchid, I hope.&rdquo; A great spray of orchids was drooping from a
crystal vase between the windows at the far side of the lighted,
heated interior of the luxurious car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Joan hesitated a perceptible second but then said with a
definiteness which had become distinctly chilly under his aggression:
&ldquo;Positively, I can&rsquo;t send Amos back with you. I&rsquo;ve kept
him out till dawn every night since I came home. He&rsquo;s going to
put the car up now. Good night, Prescott.&rdquo; She turned back
from the car step and put her ungloved hand on Enderly&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Send me those chapters, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ll read them at once and
write you. We&rsquo;ll see each other too, soon. In New York. <i>Auf
Wiedersehen.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she brushed past Hugh into the car. But she moved,
of necessity, to the farther end of the seat, for he had followed
her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better than the walk back,&rdquo; he assured
her. &ldquo;Just what I need.&rdquo; And as Joan reached a finger to a button
which plunged them into immediate velvet darkness, he added
more tensely in a lowered voice, &ldquo;Joan! It&rsquo;s three months, two
days and eight hours since we have been alone together. You
must forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan sighed. &ldquo;Well, my dear, if it&rsquo;s worth pneumonia to you
and all that&mdash;for Amos <i>is</i> going to bed, I assure you,&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like nothing better than your company. I&rsquo;ve missed you a&mdash;a
little&mdash;too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were sliding away, soundlessly rolling from under Wild
Acres&rsquo; portico into the intimate night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span></h2>
<p>Hugh slept late the next morning, and instead of being
the first down to breakfast was the last. He had done very well
on his business trip to Chicago, however, and felt that he could
afford to sleep as long as he liked. He had got to bed very late.
This was not because Joan had kept him up. She had not, or had
done so only indirectly. He had merely driven to Holly with her,
a drive of less than ten minutes, and immediately on arrival set
out on his walk home. That is, he had started off in the direction
of Wild Acres, but when he came to the entrance of the
avenue he found in himself no desire and, in fact, a repugnance
both for dancing and sleeping. So, overcoatless, hatless and in
only thin patent-leather pumps, he had tramped off for miles
up the Hudson and back.</p>
<p>It had been a simple state of misery that sent him off on the
walk. But it was not Joan&rsquo;s fault. Neither from his point of view
nor hers. She had been rather unusually nice to him, in fact.
The brief minutes alone with her in her car had begun with
silence, but a silence palpitant with potentialities. There had
been many such silences between them before, scattered sparsely
but vividly through the past fifteen years. Out of one of them,
some day, salvation might come. Joan might say, &ldquo;I love you
enough to marry you, my dear. At last I am sure of it.&rdquo; For it
was these silences that kept Hugh going, and nourished hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>He sat, leaning a little forward, watching the road ahead over
Amos&rsquo; shoulder through the glass which separated them from
the driver&rsquo;s seat. And Joan, in her corner, her head tilted back,
watched him through the silent few minutes that swept them
down the wood road&mdash;which was all their avenue amounted to
really&mdash;to the wide Post Road. There, on the highway, by the
infrequent lights, she contemplated his clear-cut profile. But
she wanted to see his eyes. She knew that they must be clouded
with miserable hunger, but she had a desire to see, to be sure
once again. Suddenly, the want conquered her whim of displeasure
with him. She drew out of her corner, came nearer,
and thrusting an arm through his elbow found his hand, and
their palms met in a slow pressure. She broke the silence, hardly
knowing that she spoke. &ldquo;Kiss me, Hugh. Kiss me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was anger or passion that uttered the demand
Joan didn&rsquo;t know. Perhaps it was merely her old insatiable desire
to keep Hugh&rsquo;s desire from weakening. Perhaps sometime&mdash;perhaps
even quite soon&mdash;she would know and understand
herself. That was her hope. For she was in the very middle of
being psychoanalyzed. Her doctor had been on the Riviera and
in Bermuda, stopping at hotels conveniently near to her own,
combining work with vacation the past few months. Her sudden
and unexpected return had occurred only because another
patient with whom he had supposedly finished treatment had
backslid and sent him an urgent <i>S O S</i> from New York. Thereupon,
Doctor Steiner had persuaded Mrs. Nevin that the time
had come for her to meet her problems face to face, with no
further evasion. And Hugh was the chief of these problems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The question was: Was she in love with Hugh Weyman
enough to marry him? Doctor Steiner had undertaken to help
her discover the answer to this question by means of a minute
and indefatigable research into her nightly dreams. This process
necessitated a two-hour daily s&eacute;ance with himself,&mdash;the
two hours being sacredly dedicated to an intimate hashing over
of Joan&rsquo;s emotional life and history.</p>
<p>Hugh, so far, knew nothing of this. But his mother had
known from the beginning and been interested and sympathetic.
Soon now, in all probability, Joan would decide to talk about it
with Hugh himself. For while she had been able to hold him
in a state of uncertainty and loyalty during the years since her
husband had died, her excuses for indecision were beginning to
wear too thin, even to herself. Besides, Hugh had not written to
her once during her entire absence this winter, in spite of her
having sent him two or three very interesting and even affectionate
letters. That he was trying to gain his emotional independence
was evident to her even without Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s
elucidations. His pride was becoming too deeply involved.</p>
<p>When she took him into her confidence about this business
of being psychoanalyzed she would have to explain how Doctor
Steiner had discovered that she, Joan, was so complicated an
individual, so highly organized emotionally as well as physically,
that things were not nearly so simple and straight for her
as for more ordinary and perhaps fortunate persons,&mdash;people
like Hugh himself, for instance, who knew so definitely what
he wanted, and had no agonizing conflicts between his impulses
and his actions. When her analysis was completed, she
would tell him, but not till then, she might be able to give herself
to a husband in the whole-hearted and elemental way which
Hugh&rsquo;s type would demand in a wife. And she might not. The
final word really must rest on Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s findings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>All this she might reveal to Hugh soon&mdash;but not to-night.
She was a little sleepy to-night, and anyway, there was a quicker
and simpler way of snatching him back if he really was pulling
at a slightly worn leash and inhibited by pride. The easier way
had also the merits of having been tested many, many times
before on Hugh, and always it had worked with mathematical
certainty. So she had whispered, angrily or passionately&mdash;it
didn&rsquo;t matter which&mdash;&ldquo;Kiss me, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-night it worked as expected, except for a slight hitch. But
the hitch was, indeed, so slight and so passing that it hardly
bothered her at all. In fact, it added zest. With Hugh&rsquo;s free
hand, the hand not clasped to the palm of hers, he put her
away from him. But his face was so close that she could almost
discern what she had wanted to discern, the hunger in his
dark eyes in the less-dark interior of her speeding motor. His
touch was gentle but his voice was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan! It&rsquo;s got to be more than this. You know how I want
you. I&rsquo;m not going on playing at love. I&rsquo;m through. Have been
all winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stayed very still in his repudiating grip. But she smiled.
She could wait, smiling. She had only to wait a minute, however.
And it was a blissful minute, tinglingly electric with her
power over him. His arm went suddenly around her shoulders.
She lifted her face. He kissed her eyes shut before he kissed her
slightly parted lips.</p>
<p>Joan could surrender more in a kiss than many women can
surrender in a life-time of more dangerous giving,&mdash;for all
the complexities and refined subtilities of her nature. Joan&rsquo;s
desire for Hugh&rsquo;s desire was fully satisfied in that long kiss.
As for Hugh, flames&mdash;a conflagration&mdash;roared against the
dark of his mind. This was chaos to him, not satisfaction. But
a shadowy sort of consolation would come to him later in the
realization that once again Joan had loved him a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Now he was holding her cheek close against his with the
hand that had held her away a minute ago. Their faces were
as close, as hard pressed, as the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>Not until the motor slowed to a stop and Amos had got
down and was coming around to open the car door did they
draw apart. Joan moved then, and the interior of the car
was flooded with light. How could she have delivered them
up so ruthlessly to the glare? Probably for appearances. But
surely Joan was superior to wanting to justify herself to her
chauffeur!</p>
<p>Hugh saw her bright lips smiling, satisfied. His kisses had
not crushed out their brightness. Her eyes, too, were bright
and enigmatically smiling. She barely touched the hand he
held to her as she alighted. But what had he expected! It was
like a dream that recurs.... And the waking was always the
same.</p>
<p>They were standing together at her door, but as yet Hugh
had not rung the bell. She did not wait for him to do so, but
stretched her own hand, as she had stretched it to turn on the
light that brought desolation in the car a minute ago, and simultaneously
turned to speak to Amos, who remained at
attention by the limousine door. &ldquo;What are you waiting for,
Amos? That is all for to-night.&rdquo; But Amos was not the complete
automaton he might appear. He said, &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d be
taking Mr. Weyman back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He prefers to walk. Good night, Amos.&rdquo; The hall door was
opening. Amos muttered half audibly, but intending Joan to
hear, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing at all to drive Mr. Weyman back to Wild
Acres. He&rsquo;s not&mdash;dressed for walking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was very short with his incivility. &ldquo;Do as I say,&rdquo; she
commanded crisply. &ldquo;And put the car up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Then she gave her hand to Hugh. &ldquo;Good night, Hugh,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;Do run over and see me often, now I&rsquo;m back,
won&rsquo;t you? We&rsquo;ve lots to get caught up with. No end of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She passed the butler, who continued to hold the door open
until Hugh had nodded to him absently and turned away into
the night.</p>
<p>Now, after his solitary mid-morning breakfast, Hugh came
leisurely out into the hall, lighting a cigarette. The house had
been so quiet ever since his rising that he wondered where
every one was. But here was Anne, in the hall, under his nose,
sitting still as a mouse in the very chair Joan had glorified last
night, while allowing her overshoes to be buckled. Hugh
seemed to remember that when he had gone in to breakfast
half an hour ago Anne had been there. She was smoking
cigarettes, and had, apparently, been some time at it, for the
silver letter tray on the table near was cluttered to overflowing
with twisty pale stubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello. Still here! What&rsquo;s up?&mdash;I&rsquo;m looking for Ariel. It
looks as if you were looking for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact it did. There was an ominous ring about Anne&rsquo;s quiet,
now that he was within its radius.</p>
<p>Anne inclined her head just slightly toward the library door,
which was shut. &ldquo;Your Ariel&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; she informed Hugh,
in a furious low voice. &ldquo;But it would be too unkind to disturb
her. She&rsquo;s busy with her latest conquest. I should have thought
Glenn would have been enough to begin with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh made a movement toward the library door, but Anne
intercepted him, jumping up and grabbing his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please <i>don&rsquo;t</i>, Hugh. It&rsquo;s twenty-five minutes of eleven. The
boys&rsquo; train goes at five past, if they&rsquo;re going to be at Professor
Barker&rsquo;s party this afternoon. I&rsquo;m simply dying to see whether
Ariel&rsquo;s charms will make Prescott lose that train. I know he&rsquo;s
crazy about the party because Masefield&rsquo;s going to be there.
Glenn&rsquo;s crazy about it too. He&rsquo;ll expect Prescott to be packed
and all ready now. And he isn&rsquo;t. And he won&rsquo;t be&mdash;not if he
and Ariel keep it up much longer. Give the girl a chance!
Have a heart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked at his sister curiously. This was an Anne strange
to him. She was so distrait and altogether unnatural that he
was concerned. But he asked quietly, &ldquo;How do you know
they&rsquo;re in there, dear? I don&rsquo;t hear voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Neither have I, for ages. For an hour or more.
I just happened to see them going in together, that&rsquo;s all. They
didn&rsquo;t see me. He shut the door behind them very carefully.
It never is shut. He went to a lot of trouble to get it over
the rug. I won&rsquo;t have them disturbed! I&rsquo;m guarding their
privacy! That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Anne! Of course we&rsquo;re not going to let him
miss the train. Hello! Here&rsquo;s a letter for Ariel.&rdquo; He picked a
letter from the floor which had evidently been thrown there
by Anne when she appropriated the letter tray for her ash
tray. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rest of the mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose took it up to Mother. There wasn&rsquo;t anything for you.
I took charge of Ariel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did? Well, I&rsquo;ll take charge of it now. I&rsquo;m going to
open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant longer Anne clutched his arm. But he moved
forward, and she gave it up, dropping back.</p>
<p>He stood for some few seconds, Ariel&rsquo;s letter in his hand, in
the open doorway. Then he turned his head and looked at
Anne. She was looking past him into the quiet room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Ariel was there, in a chair, feet curled under her, by one of the
farther windows, bent absorbedly above a book on her knees.
She was so absorbed, indeed, that she had not heard the opening
door. Enderly was sunk deep in another chair, the length of
the room away. His was a cushioned, low chair. His legs were
sprawled apart, his head was tilted back, and his arms were
dropped over the chair arms, the fingers brushing the rug,&mdash;so
total was his relaxation. His mouth, too, was slightly open.
His slumber was profound.</p>
<p>In the direct flood of morning light, seen all unconscious like
this, the boy looked unpleasantly pale and even dissipated,
Hugh thought. It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty picture, anyway, and with a
sense of relief, he turned his back on it and crossed the room
to Ariel. It was only when he offered her the letter that she
woke, with a start, to his presence. But she cried out with pleasure
at sight of the envelope addressed to her.</p>
<p>Enderly was waked by that and sat up. &ldquo;Hello. What time
is it? I&rsquo;ve been asleep. I say, <i>was</i> I asleep, Anne?&rdquo;&mdash;For Anne
was there, looking down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a little party like last night&rsquo;s knocks you out, I don&rsquo;t see
what&rsquo;s to become of you, old thing! You&rsquo;ve got two minutes or
so to pack in. Come along and I&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo; There was something
jagged, hysterical, in Anne&rsquo;s voice and her laugh. It
worried Hugh.</p>
<p>Ariel was tearing open her letter. &ldquo;What made Enderly shut
the door, anyway?&rdquo; Hugh asked, when Anne and the novelist
were out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What door?&rdquo; She was eagerly unfolding her letter, but
Hugh did not notice her excitement. &ldquo;The door there,&rdquo; he
said dryly. &ldquo;It never is shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? He said it was drafty, I think. He was cold. Wanted to
sit by the fire.&rdquo; Her eyes were eating up the pages of her letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Hugh hesitated by her side another minute, then turned
away. Ariel called him back. &ldquo;Excuse my rudeness,&rdquo; she begged.
&ldquo;But you see&mdash;this letter! It&rsquo;s so awfully important! It&rsquo;s from
Charlie Frye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it!&rdquo; Hugh was very much interested at once. Ariel
went to him and stood so that he could read with her, over
her shoulder.</p>
<p>After a minute of following the small, printlike script that
was Charlie Frye&rsquo;s handwriting, he suddenly cried out himself
with pleased excitement. &ldquo;But this is stupendous! Do you realize?
It&rsquo;s Michael Schwankovsky himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Ariel flapped over one sheet and went on to the next.
&ldquo;Of course. But do you think Charlie ought to hand over the
thing to him so absolutely? Would Father like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course he would. Why, Ariel! It&rsquo;s the best thing in
the world that could happen to us and to your father&rsquo;s pictures.
Don&rsquo;t you know? Don&rsquo;t you see? If any one can make
an exhibit a go, Schwankovsky is that one. The old boy&rsquo;s as
rich as Cr&oelig;sus too, and will buy some of them himself if he&rsquo;s
this interested. And he&rsquo;ll exhibit in the New Texas Galleries,
I bet you anything! Frye, if he&rsquo;d been lucky, might have secured
a little space in the Opportunity Gallery perhaps. Yes&mdash;I was
right. Here &rsquo;tis. The New Texas Galleries. And for one week!
Ye gods, Ariel! Our fortune&rsquo;s made! And Gregory Clare&rsquo;s
name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the news was, in all truth, stupendous Ariel knew as
well as Hugh. Michael Schwankovsky had by chance seen some
of the Gregory Clare pictures in Charlie&rsquo;s New York studio,
and straightway offered to sponsor and finance the &ldquo;whole
show.&rdquo; That meant that he had recognized her father&rsquo;s great
genius at sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>She cried, suddenly clapping her hands like a child, &ldquo;Think
of it! Michael Schwankovsky! And in spite of Mrs. Nevin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked at Ariel in quick surprise. Now why had she
said that? Why was she so delighted that this great luck had
befallen the exhibition <i>in spite of Joan</i>?</p>
<p>But was it in spite of Joan? Now that Ariel had reminded
him of her, Hugh saw that it was Joan who had done it all.
Bless her! And it was rather wonderful of her not to have told
him last night. She had sent her friend, Schwankovsky, to
Frye&rsquo;s studio with just this end in view.</p>
<p>Hugh was exhilarated enough in the good fortune that
seemed promised to the Gregory Clare exhibition now; but
he was even more exhilarated that Joan had been kind enough
to use her influence. For what she did for Ariel she did for
Hugh himself. Or so he thought,&mdash;in his own mind having
identified Ariel&rsquo;s good with his. Ariel was as close to his heart
as Anne almost, even in this short time, and he was more responsible
for her than for Anne. For Anne needed only his
financial support. That was easy enough. Ariel needed something
infinitely more subtile&mdash;and, yes&mdash;more important. Affection
which she could count on, and sympathy. Hugh realized
that he had never in his life been vital to any other living
soul in precisely the way Ariel made him feel that he was vital
to her. If Joan had wanted to marry him ten years ago, instead
of Nevin, and Persis and Nicky were his and hers, he
might have toward those children something of this same
consoling sense of obligation. It was what his life had missed
even more than it had missed intimate companionship with
the woman he loved. And now, at last, he and Joan were sharing
a living, lovely, common interest&mdash;Ariel&rsquo;s good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, you must have already seen this Schwankovsky
person, Ariel. Did you know? He was the bearded creature
who met Mrs. Nevin at the boat. They&rsquo;re great friends.&mdash;So
perhaps this isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;in spite of Mrs. Nevin.&rsquo; See here! Let&rsquo;s us
two go for a walk and celebrate by having lunch together, just
ourselves, at an inn I know near Scarsdale. And, I say, Ariel,
wear your white coat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span></h2>
<p>Mrs. Nevin had been visiting in Philadelphia at a
house party a few days, and Hugh had not the opportunity to
thank her for what he was convinced was the result of her
machinations concerning the Clare pictures. He thought of
writing, but decided against it, preferring to express to her
face the gratitude which he felt so deeply. Strange, sweet gratitude,
really. Soon now her voice might come to him on the
telephone either at his office or Wild Acres, to tell him that she
was back and wanted to see him. For because it was Hugh who
did most of the wanting, the initiative had become, gradually,
almost entirely Joan&rsquo;s. She knew, and he knew that she knew,
that he would break an appointment with heaven itself for a
three-minute encounter with her anywhere, any time. And
this being true, the initiative had to be hers, unless he were to
lose her altogether; for if it were his he would only drive her
from his life by constant importunities. The only way to hold
Joan, Hugh knew, was by letting her go.</p>
<p>Her summons came sooner than he had dared hope. The
telephone on his office desk rang joyfully. She was to be in town
that evening, she said, for a dinner at Schwankovsky&rsquo;s. Afterwards
Michael wouldn&rsquo;t mind a bit if Hugh turned up there.
They&rsquo;d probably dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Hugh went, of course. It was the first time he had ever been
invited to Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s house. And to-night it was
not in any sense, he knew, Schwankovsky&rsquo;s invitation, but entirely
Joan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When he got to the mansion&mdash;for Schwankovsky&rsquo;s house on
Riverside Drive was no less&mdash;Hugh was taken up in the
house elevator, run by a footman in Schwankovsky&rsquo;s livery,
to the top floor, where the host and his dinner guests were dancing
in the long gallery. This was&mdash;the World knew&mdash;where
Schwankovsky&rsquo;s collection of oils was hung, and Hugh wondered,
as the elevator ascended, whether the connoisseur had
perhaps already snaked out some of the best of the Clare pictures
for himself, and whether they were already up here in the
famous gallery. He did not know the ethics of the business,
or whether, indeed, Frye had the right to sell ahead of the exhibition.
But even if he might not purchase them, it was conceivable
that the man who was to finance and advertise the
exhibition could borrow from it ahead, at will, any pictures
he wished.</p>
<p>Hugh thought of Ariel. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll want to know every last detail,
which pictures are here, how they look by electric light,
everything. I must take particular pains to notice and remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator let him out directly into the gallery. A dozen
couples were dancing. An electrola was blaring. Joan saw him,
left her partner, and crossed to him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice of you to come. Don&rsquo;t bother whether you know people
or not. Just cut in and dance with them. Have a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. But can&rsquo;t we talk&mdash;you and I? Must it be
dancing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, for a while, anyway. We&rsquo;ve only just begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going out to Holly to-night? Is your car here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not going home till to-morrow morning. I&rsquo;m staying
with Brenda Loring. You remember her? Be nice to her to-night.
She quite betrayed her girlish heart concerning you
in Philadelphia. She was at the house party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh had met Miss Loring several times at Holly, and she
was one of the very few girls among Joan&rsquo;s acquaintances who
cherished the illusion that he was unattached. She danced past
at the moment with Michael Schwankovsky and smiled brilliantly
at Hugh around&mdash;she could not possibly manage it
over&mdash;the big man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Hugh noticed Joan&rsquo;s recently discarded partner, who had
seized the opportunity of Joan&rsquo;s welcoming Hugh to get himself
a drink at the buffet set up temporarily near the electrola,
turning toward them. &ldquo;Not yet, you idiot!&rdquo; he cried inwardly,
and took Joan quickly into his arms. They danced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to write you, Joan. But I waited. You can&rsquo;t know
what a brick I think you&rsquo;ve been. How I appreciate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was exchanging lip and eye signals with her host, who,
still with Brenda Loring, was passing them again, and she
barely noticed Hugh&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any of the pictures up here, though. Perhaps it&rsquo;s
more advisable to wait and spring them on the public, all at
once. Is that the idea? Knock their eyes out? I must speak to
your friend about &lsquo;Noon.&rsquo; He&rsquo;ll want that in the exhibition, of
course. I&rsquo;ve given it to Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! What <i>are</i> you talking about? Hold me closer. That&rsquo;s
right. You haven&rsquo;t caught on yet, have you? You&rsquo;ll have to,
though. This step has come to stay. It <i>is</i> a little intricate. But
try now. That&rsquo;s better!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>At least he was holding her closer. But his heart and his pulse
found it hard to keep the slow rhythm. They boomed, pounded,
plunged as though he were one with some cosmic ocean. And
the new step Joan wanted him to learn was mathematically precise,
for all that the partner must be held so very close.</p>
<p>It was naturally, then, some time before Hugh got back to
the subject of the exhibition, and he only returned to it at all&mdash;desperately
trying to ignore the mad race of his blood&mdash;because
of Ariel. He must take news to her, detailed news, since Frye
had neglected to write again in answer to her instant letter of
many eager questions. Joan, of course, could now tell him all
that they wanted to know. He hoped Ariel would be awake
when he got home and thought she would; for he had telephoned
her that he was to see Schwankovsky himself to-night.
He had refrained from mentioning Joan only because Ariel,
strangely, seemed to resent Joan&rsquo;s part in her amazing good
fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too splendid about Schwankovsky&mdash;that he should be
so enthusiastic about the pictures!&rdquo; he managed finally. &ldquo;Did
you have to do much persuading&mdash;after he had seen them, I
mean? And have you seen any of them yourself yet? Joan! You
were a darling to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were the other two again, Schwankovsky smiling intimately
into Joan&rsquo;s passing eyes, Miss Loring into Hugh&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Like silly monkeys going past on a merry-go-round. I wish
they&rsquo;d stop it. Joan won&rsquo;t listen. She hasn&rsquo;t heard a word,&rdquo;
Hugh groaned to himself. And all the time there was his thundering
heart, his pulse to ignore,&mdash;holding Joan close like
this in the slow movements of the dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Schwankovsky think the exhibition is bound to be
a success?&rdquo; Hugh&rsquo;s voice raised itself, insistent, above the electrola&rsquo;s
blare, and above the thundering of the cosmic sea in his
blood. Joan began to pay attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;What exhibition?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Which exhibition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ariel&rsquo;s.... The Gregory Clare pictures, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So it&rsquo;s Ariel again. Good Heavens! I keep forgetting
that wretched girl. The wretched artist-father too! Sorry, Hugh.
I know you feel responsible about the stupid business. That
you&rsquo;re worried. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be! But it isn&rsquo;t at all likely that
Michael knows anything about that silly exhibition,&mdash;if there
is really to be one. Why should he be bothered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought that Schwankovsky&mdash;that you, Joan&mdash;that
you&rsquo;d got him to look at the pictures, and that that was why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan laughed tolerantly. &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t got him to look at
them. I don&rsquo;t even know where they are, in fact. And I&rsquo;m glad
I don&rsquo;t. After the sample you showed me! But there&rsquo;s nothing
to keep <i>you</i> from pulling wires for Ariel, if you like. Why,
you might even get Michael as a patron for the event. What a
delicious idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schwankovsky joined them at this point in their conversation
of cross-purposes. The music had fallen mercifully silent
for the minute. Joan took the big man possessively by the arm.
&ldquo;I invited Hugh here to-night,&rdquo; she began, explaining to him,
&ldquo;to see me. But he&rsquo;s not interested in me. Only in some wretched
little artist&rsquo;s exhibition. I suspect he means to tackle you next,
Michael.&mdash;Better first-hand than second-hand, Hugh.&mdash;But
I&rsquo;m warning you, Michael! Hugh&rsquo;s on the prowl for strings to
pull to-night. He&rsquo;s all on the make&mdash;for the artist&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus made things, as she thought, simple for her
simple friend, Joan gave herself up to the arms of a new partner
simultaneously with the reawakening of the electrola to
a fresh burst of racket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Hugh had not the slightest idea of how he had managed it,
but, plainly, during their brief moments of contact he had
irritated Joan beyond endurance. And now he must gather
up the pieces of himself which she had left and be coherent
for his involuntary host. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the Clare pictures I was
discussing with Joan,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I thought she had had
something to do with your interest in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Clare pictures! What do you know about the Clare pictures,
if you please, Mr. Weyman? Or Mrs. Nevin, for the matter
of that? Kindly tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man was openly annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know? Well, not much. Except, of course, that
you&rsquo;ve taken &rsquo;em on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie Frye wrote it to us. Since then, we&rsquo;ve heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie Frye! Young idiot! Now why should he go around
telling this, when I particularly requested that he shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, he had to let <i>us</i> know! Naturally we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pff. Since it&rsquo;s out, it&rsquo;s out. No matter. Only it was going to
be something of a satisfaction, springing an exhibition like
that on New York. But now you and Joan know! Probably he&rsquo;s
told everybody. Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose it really matters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blustered off without another word or look, leaving Hugh
stranded. Didn&rsquo;t Schwankovsky know that Ariel was at Wild
Acres with the Weymans? That Hugh was her host? Apparently
not.</p>
<p>Miss Loring, seeing Hugh so suddenly and unequivocally
disengaged, forsook her own group by the buffet and started
to insinuate her way through the room toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got to catch a train,&rdquo; he thought, to put himself in countenance
with himself. If Miss Loring got to him before the elevator
arrived, summoned by his urgent finger, he would say it
aloud. He looked at his watch. True enough! If he was to catch
the hour&rsquo;s train from the Grand Central, he must get himself
on the inside of a taxi in something less than a minute. The
elevator beat Miss Loring, and Hugh was grateful.</p>
<p>In the taxi he began sorting it out. Schwankovsky had seen
Gregory Clare&rsquo;s pictures all right, and he had taken the exhibition
in charge. But Joan had had nothing to do with it, and
in fact knew nothing about it. And Schwankovsky himself
hadn&rsquo;t a hint of Hugh&rsquo;s connection with the artist or with his
daughter. Probably he wasn&rsquo;t even aware that Joan herself
knew Ariel. Surprising, perhaps, but not unaccountable. Charlie
Frye mightn&rsquo;t even have mentioned that she had left Bermuda.&mdash;And
Hugh decided that his having bolted away from that
party didn&rsquo;t matter. He couldn&rsquo;t think that Miss Loring would
be unconsolable, and no one else would even notice. Certainly
Joan wouldn&rsquo;t. Asking him to come had been the merest impulse&mdash;a
fragile impulse at that&mdash;just a slight flutter of well-meaningness
toward poor old Hugh.</p>
<p>He looked drawn as he paid off his taxi driver at the Grand
Central and mingled his stride with the throngs pouring toward
their various locals on the lower level.</p>
<p>His mother was reading in bed when he got home. She
called out to him. Propped among snowy pillows, swathed in
a rosy negligee under a rosy bedside light, she was reading a
book of &ldquo;Cases,&rdquo;&mdash;collected and edited by Joan&rsquo;s Doctor
Steiner. For unpleasantness of subject they competed tolerably
with the popular murder mysteries of the day, and for the ingenuity
of their unraveling and denouements they competed
not at all, but superbly surmounted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ariel in bed?&rdquo; Hugh inquired. Mrs. Weyman closed the
book, but kept a finger in it. &ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
just this side of sharpness, while her welcoming smile changed
into an irritated frown. &ldquo;Really! Hugh! Don&rsquo;t you expect quite
a lot of me these days? Three times this week I&rsquo;ve dined with
that girl alone here. We&rsquo;ve nothing to say to each other. If
Grandam came down, it would help. But no, Ariel seems to
have become my eternal vis-&agrave;-vis. Joan&rsquo;s away. Mrs. Drake and
the Eddingtons and &rsquo;most everybody else, for the matter of
that, are still in Florida. Even without Ariel it would be dreary
enough&mdash;But <i>with</i> her! And you come rushing in&mdash;&rsquo;<i>Is Ariel
in bed?</i>&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mother. But Joan&rsquo;s back. You&rsquo;ll see her to-morrow,
probably. That will help. And the exhibition&rsquo;s on the
way,&mdash;less than two months to wait. After that Ariel might
go abroad, or something, with some nice older woman. Meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Hugh! Meanwhile? It&rsquo;s appalling! What to do
with her! And how&rsquo;s she to go abroad, or do anything&mdash;without
any money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mother! You&rsquo;re crying! Why? I hadn&rsquo;t an idea you
were so bothered! Poor darling!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve an idea. Why don&rsquo;t <i>you</i>
go to Europe right now, this spring? We can manage it beautifully&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you unchaperoned here with this young person,
I suppose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous! Unchaperoned! But if you must be so
considerate, darling, there&rsquo;s Grandam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? But <i>is</i> there? I sometimes wonder! Grandam might
as well be living in the highest snow of the Andes for all the
contact she has with <i>us</i> these days! Her r&ouml;le as chaperone
wouldn&rsquo;t have much illusion for the servants, or even for the
world at large, I&rsquo;m afraid, Hugh dear. But in any case I don&rsquo;t
want to be driven away, if you please, from my home and my
children and my friends by your Ariel Clare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was utterly taken aback. He had not known that his
mother harbored any resentment whatever toward Ariel. And
why in heaven&rsquo;s name should she! But he said, after a moment
of quick thought, &ldquo;Look here, Mother! Ariel can go in to New
York with me mornings. There&rsquo;ll be plenty for her to do all
day, seeing the sights. That&rsquo;ll get her off your hands. I only
haven&rsquo;t suggested it before because she&rsquo;ll need money, batting
around by herself, and the poor girl&rsquo;s awfully touchy about
money right now. If she weren&rsquo;t so proud&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s strange, suddenly hysterical laugh halted him.
&ldquo;So proud!&rdquo; she gibed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you suggest that she pawn
the fur coat you gave her, Hugh! She wouldn&rsquo;t need any further
resources for a long time. She <i>could</i> go to Europe then, or
anywhere else she wanted to&mdash;comfortably. But certainly
you&rsquo;re not to dry-nurse her days in New York. That&rsquo;s absurd.
Something will come along to solve the problems, I know.
It&rsquo;ll have to. Thursday, though, I <i>will</i> let you take your turn,
since you suggest it. It&rsquo;s my day for the Shakespeare Club, and
Ariel certainly wouldn&rsquo;t fit. So your New York plan will be
useful for that one day. You are a self-sacrificing old dear!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Hugh, on leaving his mother, walked quietly out to the
guest-room wing and stood for a few seconds before Ariel&rsquo;s
shut door. All was still. So very still that he actually <i>sensed</i> a
girl sleeping. He wanted to go in, to look at her asleep. Her
room, when she was in it, was, he knew, like a still little corner
in the sky, cold, star-filled.... She was precious to him, this
daughter of his friend, every hour more so, as he came to know
her better. Was this tenderness that welled in his heart merely
the automatic tenderness which most people do harbor for what
is helpless and dependent on them, and not really the unique
thing he felt it? He scarcely knew.</p>
<p>But as he turned away from Ariel&rsquo;s door, he was thinking of
Joan. He felt that he knew to-night, definitely and forever,
that she would never relent, never love him. Her indifference
to Ariel and Ariel&rsquo;s good had convinced him. It was as if in
refusing to share some of his tenderness for Ariel, Joan had
refused to give him a child. This was absurd, on the surface,
he was aware, but it had deep roots of truth somewhere,
strongly reaching down into reality.</p>

<p>Thursday came, and Ariel was prepared to go to
town with Hugh. They were breakfasting together. The day
was clear and sunny. Ariel was wearing her green hat with the
magic feather, and her fur coat was lying with her pocketbook
on a near-by chair, ready to be snatched up when they had finished
their toast and coffee.</p>
<p>Ariel put down her cup suddenly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We
want the address of Charlie&rsquo;s studio. I forgot it.&rdquo; They planned
to look Mr. Frye up at his studio and invite him to lunch
with them. His number might not be obtainable from the
New York telephone book, so Hugh let Ariel run up to her
room. He heard her humming on the stairs. His heart smote
him a little. She was so gay, so expectant. An excursion to New
York the cause! Why, he should have given her that excursion
days ago,&mdash;and several of them! He heard her voice on the
stairs but not her feet. Somehow that humming put him back
five years, into the studio&rsquo;s loggia, sitting there smoking with
Gregory Clare, steeped in sunlight,&mdash;flower-light too, because
the flowers in and around the Clare studio did give off light
of their own. They were so still, Hugh and his friend, that
butterflies crossed and recrossed close before their faces in their
commerce with the flowers. It had been an adventure in friendship,
and he, Hugh Weyman, had not lived up to the riches
it offered him. He had failed. Since Ariel&rsquo;s coming, and her
and Grandam&rsquo;s rescue of &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; from the attic, Hugh had realized
poignantly how he had turned back at the very beginning
of that adventure and let his friend go on alone with it.
Gregory&rsquo;s last letter to him had proved that he <i>had</i> gone on
with it, only half aware that his friend was not abreast of him
in the golden realm of imagination and love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>So it was from the Bermuda loggia that he was recalled by
his mother surprisingly coming into the dining room at this
unusual hour.</p>
<p>He jumped up and pulled a chair from the table for her.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you, Mother, or hear you.&rdquo; He was almost abashed
at the completeness of his day-dreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the wretchedest night, Hugh. Hardly slept a wink.
Miss Peters has thrown up her job, or Grandam has fired her.
I can&rsquo;t make out which. Anyway, she&rsquo;s going this morning.
She told me, quite casually, when I ran into her in the butler&rsquo;s
pantry last night. She was getting hot milk for Grandam. And
she&rsquo;s just told Ariel now. On the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How her telling Ariel applied to the matter Hugh didn&rsquo;t at
the moment pause to consider or inquire. He said, reasonably,
&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s always the agency. I&rsquo;ll go there first thing&mdash;before
lunch, anyway. But Miss Peters will have to stay on, of
course, till we do get a good person. You told her that, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t ring.&rdquo; His mother stopped his hand that would
have brought Rose. &ldquo;Heaven knows I don&rsquo;t want breakfast.
Not now. Not till something&rsquo;s settled. It&rsquo;s too ridiculous, Hugh,
but your grandmother hasn&rsquo;t any intention that we shall replace
Miss Peters for her. She has already engaged some one.
I thought, possibly, you knew,&mdash;thought, in fact, you <i>would</i>
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. But then that&rsquo;s all right. Is the new person coming
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman replied dryly, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here now. But she herself
didn&rsquo;t know her job began to-day,&mdash;not until Miss Peters
told her. It&rsquo;s Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Ariel&rsquo;s just off to town with me. There&rsquo;s her coat.
Anyway,&rdquo; as the significance of it all dawned on him, &ldquo;it <i>is</i>
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree. But it seems that Ariel told Grandam she wanted
a job, must have a job, and Grandam manufactured one for
her. That&rsquo;s the story. Rather unfair to Miss Peters, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that. Miss Peters was about ready,
I imagine. It was wearing pretty thin, both ways. I felt she
wasn&rsquo;t for long. You must have too, Mother. But it&rsquo;s no
job for Ariel. It&rsquo;s too difficult. A job for a strong and experienced
woman.&rdquo; Then he repeated himself lamely&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But Ariel&rsquo;s wanting a job isn&rsquo;t nonsense. I&rsquo;m
rather pleased with her for that. And you should be too. But
this&mdash;this that Grandam has given her&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s work for
a husky and sensible woman, as you say. How Grandam thinks
Ariel&rsquo;s going to be of any use to her, I don&rsquo;t see. Why, Miss
Peters gets her up, puts her to bed, runs about with heavy trays,
sweeps, dusts, scrubs. Can you visualize Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s face had grown steadily darker at the picture his
mother made so vivid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous of Grandam!&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;And I shan&rsquo;t let her do this to Ariel. Not a chance!
We&rsquo;ll get hold of just the right person somehow. There must be
some one, just the right one. I&rsquo;ll go to the agent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a comfort, Hugh. Always! And we&rsquo;ll find something
for Ariel, something more appropriate, quite easily.&rdquo; His
mother wanted now to make up to Hugh for having been
so unpleasant about Ariel the other night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday Joan and I put our heads together over it. So nice
having her at home again! We are deliciously congenial, Hugh,
in spite of our ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not looking at her son, but she was intent on his reaction
to this, all the same. She knew from Joan by now that
Hugh had been rude to her,&mdash;left rather rudely, without saying
good night, a party to which she had invited him. And Mrs.
Weyman had felt that Joan had <i>cared</i>, in spite of her laughter
in the telling. So she had begun to hope that Joan was on the
verge of &ldquo;untangling her complexes&rdquo; and surrendering to
Hugh&rsquo;s long devotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did Joan suggest,&mdash;about Ariel, I mean? Does
she by any chance know about Schwankovsky now? What
he&rsquo;s doing for Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He told her. After you&rsquo;d left his house so unceremoniously.
She&rsquo;s quite pleased. But her plan for Ariel has
nothing to do with that. The exhibition&rsquo;s not till May. Ariel
has almost two months to get through somehow, you see. Joan
says the big department stores pay living wages now. Some of
them. One has to have, however, either a college education
or some sort of personal pull, to be taken on, Joan says. Imagine,
in a department store! But Joan can supply the pull, she&rsquo;s sure.
And even better, Joan thinks she&rsquo;ll be able to get her into the
American Girls&rsquo; Club to live. Joan&rsquo;s one of the committee <i>and</i> a
trustee. Only twelve dollars a week for a good room, shared
with one or two other girls, and breakfasts and dinners. Lunches
they get near their work, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Hugh was staring at his mother in a way that seemed odd
to her. And now he took his watch up from where it had been
lying beside his plate and put it into his pocket with a leisurely
finality that seemed to indicate that time had ceased to matter
to him and expresses might go their ways unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Joan was so keenly interested in Ariel&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;But Ariel&rsquo;s my concern. Nobody else
need bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman shrugged, ever so slightly. She said, archly,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be obtuse, dear boy. Joan isn&rsquo;t interested in Ariel for
Ariel&rsquo;s sake. How could she be! Who could be? It&rsquo;s us, Joan&rsquo;s
concerned for. Me&mdash;and you. Aren&rsquo;t you grateful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she thinks she can really get Ariel into the American
Girls&rsquo; Club? But she can&rsquo;t be certain of it, of course. Aren&rsquo;t
they pretty exclusive down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman answered in all good faith. She did not
dream how much at cross purposes they had gotten in the last
few seconds, she and her son. &ldquo;Yes. They have to be exclusive,
of course. Or they&rsquo;d be overrun with immigrants. But Ariel&rsquo;s
parents were both American citizens. And morally she&rsquo;s all
right,&mdash;what&rsquo;s termed in those places, &lsquo;A good girl.&rsquo; So I
think Joan can manage it. She can manage most things, you
know. I&rsquo;ll let Ariel help with Grandam to-day&mdash;since Miss
Peters really insists on going&mdash;and by to-night you&rsquo;ll have
found a suitable woman. But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to get a
later train, Hugh, for I do need you to do the persuading with
Grandam. She&rsquo;ll listen to you. She&rsquo;ll have to. Why, it wouldn&rsquo;t
be safe to let her depend on Ariel for care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Ariel returned. She stood in the doorway and almost
burst into song in Hugh&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go into town with
you after all! <i>I&rsquo;ve got a job.</i> The job I told you about. And it&rsquo;s
already begun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Hugh went toward her. &ldquo;Mother has just told me about it.
Is it a job you really like, Ariel? Think you want to give
it a try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel treated those questions as humor. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m the luckiest girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh appeared to be joining in her transports. Mrs.
Weyman was astounded by the inexplicable right-about-face
in Hugh&rsquo;s attitude she saw taking place before her
eyes.</p>
<p>He was actually saying &ldquo;I congratulate you. I think you&rsquo;ll
see it through too,&mdash;be a grand nurse and companion, and be
as independent as blazes right up to the day of your picture
exhibition, Ariel. After that, we&rsquo;ll see what next. But now it
appears to be just a matter of marking time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was standing directly in morning sunlight, where it
made a fan on the floor and laced the door jambs with light.
Was she on her toes, just hovering? It was only for an instant,
and might have been illusion caused by too much white sunlight,
but to him she was a spirit dancing on winter air&mdash;as
her father would see her, were he here in the Weyman dining
room instead of way off in that dream loggia with the
dream butterflies over the dream sea. Her body seemed elongated,
taller with its upward lift. She was reaching out her
arms, not toward the snowy air and the sky, however, but simply
to take the coat and pocketbook which Hugh had picked
up for her from the chair where she had tossed them before
breakfast in readiness for train-catching.</p>
<p>All that Mrs. Weyman felt was that Ariel was pleased over
having stolen a march on herself and Hugh. Then the unaccountable
girl was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little unreliable, Hugh? You appeared to agree
with me that the whole thing was nonsense. Then, right on top
of that, you congratulated Ariel! Are you or are you not going
up to Grandam now and straighten her out as to what she
can and can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather say <i>not</i>. I think we can trust Grandam to go lightly
with Ariel, though it is rather whimsical of her! Not so inappropriate
though, once you get used to the idea. There&rsquo;s something
goddess-like about Grandam. So she can do with lovely
service. And it&rsquo;s better, worlds better, than Macy&rsquo;s and the
American Girls&rsquo; Club, all thanks to Joan just the same for her
interest&mdash;in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re behaving weirdly! But Ariel won&rsquo;t last with Grandam
a week, so in the end it won&rsquo;t matter. Anyway, now I
can invite people to dinner without wondering what&rsquo;s to be
done with the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Sunday. A gray dismal afternoon at Wild Acres. Mrs. Weyman
was driving with friends to New York to hear a Philharmonic
concert.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hugh, who had passed up the concert, put down
the mystery story he had intended to substitute for it and
went, three steps at a time, up to the attic apartment. He wanted
society&mdash;Grandam&rsquo;s and Ariel&rsquo;s&mdash;and perhaps to sit down at
Grandam&rsquo;s piano and play the mists away from heart and
mind. Yesterday, while he was lunching a man at the Waldorf,
the orchestra had played something of C&eacute;sar Franck&rsquo;s which
Hugh had never heard before. He thought he could remember
bits of it, work them out for Grandam this afternoon. Hugh
was musical in a temperamental, totally undisciplined way,
and for years past he had played only for Grandam or himself.
Not even his mother could persuade him. But, somehow,
Ariel&rsquo;s presence wouldn&rsquo;t matter to him a bit, he knew. Or
rather it would matter. The very thought of her listening made
his fingers want the keys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Wood smoke mingled with the smell of the violets which
bloomed perpetually in the glass bowl by the daybed. This
mixture of smells had lifelong association for Hugh. It meant
understanding and an atmosphere of exquisite harmony between
two human beings. Grandam was draped in a red shawl&mdash;the
red of wild poppies in June fields&mdash;and lying in the
long chair under the western windows. Ariel was kneeling on
the floor by her side, and they were reading from a book resting
on the arm of the chair, &ldquo;The Oxford Book of English Verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel got up when Hugh came in. She looked strange to
him, for a minute, because of a new frock she was wearing.
It was the color of wood smoke, or dim violets. It was, Hugh
thought, the mingled smell of violets and wood smoke run
into color and form. It fell in soft pleats from a silver piping
at the base of her throat, was gathered in at her waist by a silver
cord, and from there, still thickly pleated, hung in dense
thick chiffon folds down almost to her ankles. With it she was
wearing the low-heeled silver slippers that went with her green
evening frock, and silver stockings.</p>
<p>So Grandam had already dressed her serving-maid in these
first days of her service. Hugh recognized the material instantly
as having come from one of Grandam&rsquo;s most notable
scarfs, a great square of loveliness with which he had been
familiar from boyhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to play, Hugh! Well, I wanted music. Ariel
ought to run out and get the air. I&rsquo;ve been working her rather
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ariel cried, &ldquo;Not a bit of it! It&rsquo;s wonderful up here,
Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know! But have you been out of doors since you
began the job? No? Well, then Grandam&rsquo;s right and you&rsquo;d
better run along now. If you drove a car I&rsquo;d offer you the
roadster&mdash;&rdquo; But he was disappointed, all the same. He really
wanted her there, with himself and Grandam&mdash;and music.
Then Rose knocked on Grandam&rsquo;s door and interrupted their
discussion of what Ariel&rsquo;s outing should be. &ldquo;A telephone for
Mr. Weyman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Ariel knelt again beside Grandam to finish &ldquo;The
Forsaken Merman,&rdquo; he went down to his mother&rsquo;s room to
take the message on the extension telephone there. Joan was on
the wire. And she surprised him by asking at once, &ldquo;Is Ariel
Clare still at Wild Acres with you, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course.&rdquo; Did she think she was at the American
Girls&rsquo; Club or the Working Girls&rsquo; Home? he asked himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s there now, this afternoon? All right. I&rsquo;m bringing
Michael over. He wants to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that will be all right. I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The receiver at the other end went up smartly. Thoughtfully,
Hugh put his own instrument back on the table. What next?
Well, it was quite in the course of things, he supposed, that
Schwankovsky, having discovered from Frye or from Joan
that the artist&rsquo;s daughter was at Wild Acres, wanted to meet
her. Hugh didn&rsquo;t know why he had not thought of that probability
when his mother at dinner had given him the information
that Schwankovsky was week-ending at Holly. It was only
Joan&rsquo;s voice which puzzled him. So unnaturally crisp. Hugh
didn&rsquo;t believe for an instant that Joan was taking the trouble to
keep up the pretense of being put out with him for his behavior
at Schwankovsky&rsquo;s the other night. But obviously she
was put out about something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You want to discuss the exhibition with Ariel? She&rsquo;ll
be down in a minute.&rdquo; Hugh shook hands with Michael
Schwankovsky and lighted Joan&rsquo;s cigarette for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The exhibition! No, not at all. It&rsquo;s already entirely arranged
for, and will be a magnificent success. Mr. Frye has given me
<i>carte blanche</i>. It is the dancer I would see, not the lady who is
to become rich from the sale. Yes, here to look with my own
eyes on the soul of the paintings, the dancer herself. I palpitate
for one glimpse of that spirit.... When you spoke to me of
the exhibition, Mr. Weyman, at my house the other night, I
did not know that the dancer was in this country, much less
your guest. I knew nothing of your connection with the affair
whatever. But can it be true? She is really here?&rdquo; He turned
in a full circle, his glance, his hands, sweeping the library
with an amazed gesture. &ldquo;In these bourgeois surroundings!
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> But how is it done? Have you stuck a pin
through her head, Mr. Weyman? Is she mounted on cardboard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Hugh chose to treat this, as he hoped it was intended, humorously.
&ldquo;Gregory Clare was my friend,&rdquo; he explained what he
had not been allowed a chance to explain at Schwankovsky&rsquo;s
house. &ldquo;Naturally, I am delighted that you are interesting yourself
in his work. But I do not quite understand why your enthusiasm
should extend itself to his daughter whom you do
not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do not know!</i> But remember that I <i>do</i> know the pictures!
Ha!&rdquo; The huge Russian snatched from his breast pocket a very
small flat jade case, snapped it open, extracted a minute, orange-colored
cigarette, which he stuck into a very long black holder,
and began to smoke ferociously. Out of the astonishing clouds
which at once began to drift from his quivering and expansive
nostrils his voice growled and reverberated huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can one see the pictures and not adore the dancer? But, I
forget. You, Mr. Weyman, have seen the pictures, I understand,
without allowing yourself to become at all disturbed by
their beauty. You have even seen the painter himself. Seen him
once plain! Alive! In the flesh! Even called him &lsquo;Friend&rsquo;! But
from you who has ever heard a word of his great art? How is
this? Ha! He had to wait and wait and wait until he was dying
and a little trifler with art, this little Mr. Frye, came along and
thought the paintings pretty. And it is this little dabbler, this
no-account would-be painter, who consoles the dying genius,
who promises that his life&rsquo;s work shall be shown, shall be recognized.
While you, who knew him for years&mdash;Joan says it has
been many years&mdash;your part has been kindly, oh, so very,
very kindly, to take his daughter, the divine child of his muse,
and employ her as a servant in your household. But you may
intend kindness. One never knows. The certainty is that you
are blind. Your perception of beauty is dead or never existed....
I,&mdash;I have come to see the dancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael! You&rsquo;re being outrageous. Hugh, he&rsquo;s not responsible.
Don&rsquo;t even notice him. He sometimes gets this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was up, moving about restlessly. Suddenly she stopped,
swung about, put a hand on Schwankovsky&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Michael!&rdquo; she spoke as to a sleepwalker, cautiously but
firmly. &ldquo;Wait till you see your dancer. You may find that all
this excitement is sheer waste, that Hugh is right, and Ariel
is quite ordinary. Besides, she isn&rsquo;t exactly a servant here. You
misunderstood me. She&rsquo;s a companion-nurse. There&rsquo;s quite a
little difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schwankovsky shook off the quieting hand. &ldquo;Companion-nurse!&rdquo;
he bellowed. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Joan backed away from
him, more disconcerted at his having ignored her hand than
by his tone. Schwankovsky, seeing her expression, obviously
made some effort to be more peaceful. &ldquo;Forgive me, Joan, my
dear. You see I forgot that <i>you</i> had not yet seen the paintings.
You&rsquo;d know, if you had, what Mr. Weyman has no excuse for
not knowing, that it is madness and folly to pretend that the
dancer is a &lsquo;companion-nurse.&rsquo; She simply isn&rsquo;t anything of
the sort. She&rsquo;s the inspiration, soul, I can say it, of the greatest
artist of our times. She&rsquo;s the germinating force within the
outward and visible expression of his art. And this force, this
<i>Imagination</i>, inherent in all true art, has nowhere else that I
know of ever taken form and showed itself through the actual
medium&mdash;of paint, or music, or sculpture. So here we have
the unique, the unheard-of. Imagination made visible! In Ariel,
dancing.&mdash;But where is she? Why doesn&rsquo;t she come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was already there, in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; The Russian charged lumberingly upon her, and fell,
kneeling, by her silver slippers. Grabbing up her hands he
kissed them,&mdash;the palms, the backs. Hugh cried, but inaudibly,
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Ariel box his ears?&rdquo; Joan languidly sank into a
chair, lighting a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ariel,&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;The bear there on the rug is
Mr. Michael Schwankovsky. Allow me to present him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Schwankovsky bounded up,&mdash;turned on Joan. &ldquo;A totally
unnecessary waste of breath,&rdquo; he expostulated, and seized Ariel&rsquo;s
hands again. &ldquo;This divine child and I have known each other
before the creation of the world. It was she who taught my
soul the existence of form while it was yet chaos. &lsquo;Ariel.&rsquo; Why
did they name you that? It isn&rsquo;t good enough. But then, you
should be nameless. There <i>is</i> no name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh asked of Joan in a low voice, with genuine concern,
&ldquo;Is it all right? Has he been drinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan laughed, but mirthlessly. &ldquo;Not a bit of it! He&rsquo;s merely
been a little put out with me lately, and this is the reaction.
He couldn&rsquo;t take it in why I hadn&rsquo;t told him Ariel was here.
But how could I dream he&rsquo;d be interested? That it meant
anything to him? And why, in heaven&rsquo;s name, Hugh Weyman,
didn&rsquo;t you tell me that he had seen the Clare pictures and was
exhibiting them? I don&rsquo;t understand your secretiveness. It
wasn&rsquo;t like you. It was horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were away. And I thought you knew, of course.
I thought it was you yourself, Joan, who had got the old duffer
interested. I was awfully grateful to you. I tried to tell you <i>how</i>
grateful when we danced, remember? I went over there that
night all primed to bless you, and thank you, for what I supposed,
of course, you&rsquo;d done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan looked away. She was pale, he noticed, and there were
fine lines around her mouth and between her eyes. Nerves.
But he had never before seen her destitute of the glow of complacency.
It took him aback. &ldquo;If only I had seen the pictures!&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;I would have talked them up to Michael.
That goes without saying. He&rsquo;d be the logical person, obviously.
But you scarcely mentioned them, Hugh. And then Charlie
Frye&mdash;the fact of <i>him</i> sponsoring them! That threw me off,
naturally. How could I suspect that he&rsquo;d stumbled on something
really good? I was absolutely in the dark. And it was you
who kept me there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo; Hugh began. He was tempted to remind her how
he had brought her &ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; the painting which Clare himself,
dying, considered his masterpiece, and that she had laughed at
it. But he did not want to distress her any more than she was
already distressed, and so he hesitated and looked away toward
Ariel.</p>
<p>She and the Russian were sitting facing each other on the
little gilt sofa before the windows. They were in profile to the
room, knee to knee. In fact, Ariel&rsquo;s hands were palm upwards
on the big man&rsquo;s knees, while his own huge hairy hands held
them there. Hugh had no excuse to interfere, for Ariel seemed
contented. He caught words now and then from their hurried,
eager talk: <i>Gregory Clare</i> ... <i>Clare</i> ... <i>Father</i> ...
<i>Gregory</i> ... <i>Genius</i> ... <i>Studio</i> ... <i>Beauty</i> ... <i>Art</i> ...
<i>Color</i> ... <i>Sunlight</i> ... <i>Love</i> ... <i>Shells</i> ... <i>Life</i> ... <i>Father</i> ...
<i>Shells</i> ... <i>Wind</i> ... <i>Death</i> ... <i>Genius</i>....</p>
<p>Joan smoked cigarettes rapidly, lighting one from another,
as Anne sometimes smoked but Joan seldom, and flicked the
ashes onto the rug by her chair, for Hugh had neglected to provide
her with an ash tray. He remained, with head turned,
listening, as she too was listening, to the rough, deep voice
mingling with the flattened, clear tones, over by the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; Joan asked suddenly, but softly.
What she really meant was, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look at me? Listen
for my voice, not Ariel&rsquo;s? You are thinking about me, only
me, aren&rsquo;t you? It would be strange if you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh answered her spoken question dryly. &ldquo;Beauty and the
beast! An obvious and unescapable thought, don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; She barely moved her lips to whisper the name.
But although scarcely breathed, it was heavy with intended significance.
He turned to her like a shot. Their eyes met. Hers
darkened under his gaze, and the eyelids drooped, while her
lips softened, opening just perceptibly. It was the old call, more
sudden and direct than usual, and more unexpected, given
the time and the place,&mdash;but effective. Flame glared against
the blackness in Hugh&rsquo;s suddenly quenched mind. His heart
began its obedient thundering gallop....</p>
<p>Came a crash! The grizzly over by the windows had suddenly
sprung to his feet, turning over a small table in the act. A china
box and a marble figurine lay smashed to bits on the polished
floor. Both the marble and the box were cherished, valuable possessions
of Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s; but Schwankovsky&rsquo;s only apology
was a shrug of his great shoulders and a humorous arching of
bushy eyebrows in unwarranted surprise at the destruction.
He came rushing toward Joan and Hugh, sweeping Ariel with
him by a great arm. &ldquo;She says one of the pictures is here, upstairs,&rdquo;
he roared. &ldquo;A picture that Clare thought the best of
them all! It&rsquo;s up in Grannie&rsquo;s room she says, old Grannie&rsquo;s room
in the attic! We forgive Mr. Weyman his unique absence of
perceptions, perhaps&mdash;but you, Joan Nevin&mdash;<i>You!</i>&rdquo; His scorn
choked out his utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Grandam&rsquo;s room? Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen it. I haven&rsquo;t been
up there for weeks,&rdquo; Joan drawled, but her cheeks were dangerously
flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve had it for years, Ariel says. And you have told
me about this Grannie, my friend,&mdash;this old lady. You call
on her frequently. More than once in five years, if I remember.
So you <i>must</i> know this picture. And you never told me, your
friend!&rdquo; His hands were clawing his hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Hugh spoke soothingly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been in the store-room until
recently. Ariel rescued it for us out of the attic. I&rsquo;d put it there.
So Joan hasn&rsquo;t seen it&mdash;not hung in my grandmother&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was giving Joan her way out, if she cared to take it. She
could say now truly enough that she had never seen &ldquo;Noon&rdquo;
hung, and in a good light.</p>
<p>But Joan did not take advantage of the way out Hugh had
so carefully prepared for her vanity. And Schwankovsky grew
stormier. &ldquo;In the attic! You put this picture in the attic? <i>You</i>
did? And you boast of it? Then, when Ariel finds it there, you
very, very kindly let her hang it up in Grannie&rsquo;s room? Wonderful!
This is too wonderful! More and more wonderful,
and still more so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan kept a silence which masked itself as amusement. As
for Hugh, he nodded, but did not pretend to be entertained by
the vaudeville sketch in bad manners which was being imposed
upon them.</p>
<p>Let Schwankovsky think him the fool he pretended. It didn&rsquo;t
matter to him in the slightest. For Hugh had never, at any
period in his life, and least of all at this minute, aspired to
be considered &ldquo;a man with taste&rdquo; in any sense that Schwankovsky
would credit. If he had married Joan she, like so many other
American wives, would have had the responsibility for all that
sort of thing. And for the past five years Hugh had come more
and more to consider himself a business man with very little
that was &aelig;sthetic in his make-up. He acknowledged to himself
now that if to-day he should see &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; for the first time,
there was a large likelihood that he would not even make a
stab at coming to any opinion for himself as to whether it was
good or bad. Certainly he would not be pierced to his soul by
the white light&mdash;which, then, years ago, when he was young,
had seemed to him to come from some esoteric birth of beauty
behind the light itself. So he neither blamed Schwankovsky
for his choking sputterings nor felt insulted. He had the grace
to realize that five years ago he would even have been in sympathy
with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>But although he did not really mind Schwankovsky&rsquo;s rage
at himself, some unhappiness was clawing at his inner consciousness,
some psychic pain, unlocated. Was it Joan&rsquo;s cool,
smiling silence? Joan could and should be defending him
against this hot-tempered friend of hers, he realized. If she
began to, he would hush her up, of course; but she was not
even starting.... But perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t Joan. He didn&rsquo;t think
it <i>was</i>. Was it Ariel? That Ariel should be looking at him as
she was now! Her hand lay on Schwankovsky&rsquo;s mammoth
arm, the fingers clutched and lost in his great fingers. That
was a little sickening to Hugh. But it was her face, its expression,
which actually stabbed. Had Schwankovsky succeeded in
making Ariel believe what was, indeed, the truth&mdash;that Hugh
had failed her father?</p>
<p>And what did Joan expect him to do in reply to these taunts
from her friend, anyway? And why didn&rsquo;t Joan laugh out
loud, instead of smiling that way? But it was Ariel who kept
the drama melodramatic. She turned on Joan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you let your friends misunderstand each other
so?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stop being amused and set Mr.
Schwankovsky straight about Hugh? Hugh liked &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; the
best of all the pictures Father had done when he was in Bermuda.
And he <i>bought</i> it. He named his own price, and <i>paid</i> it.
<i>One thousand dollars.</i> Hugh had four thousand dollars a year
to spend then. Father knew that. And Father thought it splendid
that a man would spend one fourth of his income on a
picture. But no one goes after beauty for himself or wants it
that way. It&rsquo;s for his friends as much as himself. Hugh only
put &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; in the attic because it reminded him that he couldn&rsquo;t
share it or anything else that was real to him with you, Mrs.
Nevin. No one wants to be reminded of things like that about
any one he loves. Love is more important than art, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan assumed the appearance of looking through Ariel as
through clear glass&mdash;something that might not be there at all&mdash;but
the amusement on her lips and in her eyes turned genuine.
She spoke only to Schwankovsky and as if both Hugh and
Ariel had suddenly vanished. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wild to see this picture, now
that you tell me of it, Michael. And don&rsquo;t be cut up about finding
it in the grandmother&rsquo;s apartment. If it weren&rsquo;t rather fine
she wouldn&rsquo;t let it remain an instant. She has taste. Let&rsquo;s go up
this minute. I&rsquo;m thrilled. Ariel has been misinformed, you can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh stopped them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get Grandam&rsquo;s permission,
of course. Joan knows she&rsquo;s rather strong on etiquette,
and that one has to be announced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ariel again asserted herself: &ldquo;Grandam said I might take
Mr. Schwankovsky up. She knew he&rsquo;d want to see &lsquo;Noon.&rsquo;
And then, if she can have Mrs. Nevin too, I&rsquo;ll come down and
say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hugh and Joan were left alone he said, by way of saying
something in the face of her disconcerting, aloof silence,
&ldquo;Grandam is devoted to Ariel. She&rsquo;d let her do anything she
asked, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dressed her up, I notice. Quite touching of your
grandmother to be so interested, don&rsquo;t you think? I do. She&rsquo;s
playing a game with Ariel, I imagine. Recreating a raw personality.
Even a frock like that can&rsquo;t work miracles though,
and Grandam must know it in her heart. But life must be getting
rather dull for her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life is never dull for Grandam. At least, to me, she always
seems to be living at a higher rate of vibration than the rest
of us.&rdquo; He smiled at an idea which leapt in his mind. &ldquo;Do you
know, to me, she&rsquo;s something like babies are, under two years
at any rate, growing while they sleep, while your back&rsquo;s turned,
changing like anything, every minute. Think how marvelously
quickly they learn terribly deep and obscure things! what
words mean, for instance, and cause and effect, and all! Grandam
is still like that,&mdash;simply rushing along into new perceptions
of Life. You and I have slowed down long ago. We
feel and experience. But do we change? I don&rsquo;t, much. Not
consciously, anyway. But she&rsquo;s simply absorbed and exhilarated
with her processes of change! She&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joan had turned away and was groping for a cigarette
in the silver box on the mantel above the fire, with her back
to Hugh. &ldquo;Oh, come! That&rsquo;s enough about your grandmother.
This box is empty, drat it! I need a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some from the library,&rdquo; he offered, and was gone.
As he went, Joan turned about and looked after his back,
astounded. She had thought him almost at her shoulder&mdash;and
now he was gone, like that. When he returned she was nonchalantly
settled on the gilt sofa. She waved away the cigarette
she had said she wanted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve smoked too much to-day,&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;Much too much. I&rsquo;d like to give it up altogether.
It&rsquo;s become so usual, and it never was exactly a beautiful
performance, a woman smoking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh lighted a cigarette for himself and sat down a little
ways off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather sweet the way Ariel defended you just now,&rdquo;
Joan commented absently. &ldquo;Like a little guinea hen over its
chick. And her startling aphorisms! <i>Love is more important
than art</i>&mdash;and&mdash;<i>No one goes after beauty for himself</i>. Now, I
ask you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly Joan dropped that note and began talking
seriously about Prescott Enderly. She smoothed out the fingers
of her gloves as she went on, looking from Hugh to them,
from them to Hugh. And as the gloves got smoothed, so her
face. Under Hugh&rsquo;s eyes it bloomed again, gradually, with its
wonted complacency.</p>
<p>It amused her, she told him, when very young men fell in
love with her these days. Men older than herself&mdash;sometimes
even very much older&mdash;she had come to consider more worthy
game. When they were interesting at all they had had time, you
see, to become just that much more interesting. Michael, for
instance! He was over sixty. He looked much younger, of
course. But &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo; said sixty-two. It was Prescott
Enderly, however, she wanted to discuss with Hugh. The boy
had become, almost over night, something of a problem. She
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, middle-aged people one needn&rsquo;t worry about, no
matter how desperately infatuated they appear to themselves.
One notices they don&rsquo;t kill themselves for love. It&rsquo;s only the
very young who have the vitality to be tragic. Don&rsquo;t you agree,
Hugh? If I weren&rsquo;t so really fond of your young novelist friend,
I&rsquo;d be diverted. He&rsquo;s very dramatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is quite new to me,&rdquo; Hugh told her, as uncomfortably
as she could wish. &ldquo;I thought Enderly was Anne&rsquo;s beau. Didn&rsquo;t
know you ever saw him, in fact, until that night here.&mdash;It was
Ariel&rsquo;s first night with us, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Ariel&rsquo;s first night! Joan came near to starting, as much at
the voice as at the words themselves. It had been <i>Joan&rsquo;s</i> first
night, if you like, back from her winter away, but here was
Hugh identifying it by Ariel&rsquo;s coming to Wild Acres! And in
that rich, low, reminiscent voice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the night I met Enderly,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ve seen him since, you know. Quite a lot. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you
that I got Mrs. Allison to invite him to her house party in
Philadelphia? He was there, very much so, from Friday to
Monday. How he gets away with it at Yale I can&rsquo;t say. And he&rsquo;s
at Holly now. He&rsquo;s reading me all he&rsquo;s got done of the new
novel to-night. Pris Larkin, by the way, is week-ending too,
and your particular friend, Brenda Loring. So come over for
supper, if you like. Brenda will bless me if you do&mdash;&rdquo; She
glanced up at the clock. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be expecting us back for tea
soon now! Whatever&rsquo;s keeping Michael up there all this time?
It&rsquo;s almost half an hour I&rsquo;ve been boring you with my conquests.
What <i>is</i> keeping Michael?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture, I should suppose. And getting acquainted with
Grandam. Of course, he&rsquo;s never met any one like her before.
You mustn&rsquo;t mind her not sending down for us. Schwankovsky
in himself must be as taxing as a dozen people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; But she got up, restlessly, and wandered,
Hugh following her, into the library. There she dropped down
on the piano bench and commenced to play some Debussy.
Hugh leaned on the piano and watched her hands. They were
as strong as they were beautiful. She asked, above the music,
&ldquo;Why is Michael putting himself to such trouble to annoy me,
do you suppose? It&rsquo;s simply silly of you, my dear, to suggest
your grandmother as my rival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s Ariel too! He didn&rsquo;t appear to be exactly indifferent
to Ariel....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s playing gained in subtility of interpretation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
funny, Hugh, but poor old Michael is madly jealous of Enderly.
Last night he was quite boorish about it. And Pressy
understood the situation perfectly. It was rather delicious,
watching, but disgraceful of Michael, all the same. In some
ways Prescott is more sophisticated than Michael. In spite of
his background and youth. Perhaps the really sophisticated
mind is an accident, like genius, and can appear out of nowhere....
Michael&rsquo;s jealousy, though, does flatter the boy.
How could it not! A man like <i>that</i> jealous of <i>him</i>!... And
now, you see, Michael thinks he&rsquo;s paying me out....&rdquo; She
dropped her hands from the keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she cried, jumping up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve duties to my other
guests. So I shall have to gratify Michael to the extent of using
violence to drag him home with me, I suppose. Unless he&rsquo;s
to walk, and he&rsquo;s not so good at walking as you are, Hugh
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh could only go with her. He could hardly insist that
Grandam, who had kept the noisy, ranting Schwankovsky with
her for almost an hour, was not up to saying &ldquo;good afternoon
and good-by&rdquo; to an old acquaintance like Joan.</p>
<p>But Joan was disconcerted almost to the point of awkwardness
when they discovered Schwankovsky in the middle of tea
with Grandam and Ariel, and looking as if he would like nothing
better than to stay on all the afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Ariel, as they came in, was kneeling up straight at one side
of the hearth, toasting a big slice of graham bread which in
its very size and thickness proclaimed it had been ordered by
Schwankovsky for himself. At the other side of the hearth, at
Grandam&rsquo;s knee, he crouched, waiting for it, like some giant
Tartar on a cushion. Her scarf, falling from a shoulder,
trailed down the giant&rsquo;s back, and he had drawn the end across
a great knee. It was bright in the firelight, very bright and vital.
Ariel&rsquo;s face was pure silver, and her eyes emerald green against
the flames.</p>
<p>When Grandam saw the new arrivals she leaned farther
back in the long chair and shut her eyes for an instant. Hugh
said with quick concern, &ldquo;You are getting too tired! We don&rsquo;t
want tea, Joan and I. Hers is waiting for her at home, along
with a house full of guests who are expecting her and Mr.
Schwankovsky back for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will let Michael Schwankovsky finish his fourth
cup here, won&rsquo;t you, Joan? Now he&rsquo;s begun it? Do sit down,
both of you. Ariel, please pass the sweets to Joan and Hugh.
There&rsquo;s cheese, Michael Schwankovsky, in that jar, if you like
it on graham toast. Hugh, get a cup for yourself from the tray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh preferred to smoke,&mdash;but nothing less than a pipe
this time, for he felt Joan&rsquo;s strain and confusion; and his well-worn,
smooth and beautiful meerschaum at least gave a superficial
air of peace to the gathering.</p>
<p>Joan sat looking over Grandam&rsquo;s head to the western windows.
She observed, with something like exasperation, that
even out there, far, far in the western sky, the red-violet light
of the clearing evening was turning the very heavens into a
mere extension of Grandam&rsquo;s apartment. In the smell of browning
toast, the firelight, the laughter, Ariel&rsquo;s silver slippers coming
and going in Grandam&rsquo;s hospitality, the smoke from Hugh&rsquo;s
meerschaum, and the shadows dancing on its bowl, she refused
to take pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>But Schwankovsky would not let her stay out of it whether
she felt at home or not. He sprang to his feet, seized her by the
elbows, pulled her up, and walked her backwards, away from
the fireplace into the center of Grandam&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
looked at &lsquo;Noon&rsquo;!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;My Ariel was right. It is the
jewel of them all. I admit it. Clare didn&rsquo;t go beyond that even
in &lsquo;The Shell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wonder if it is well, my friend, that you are seeing
the best first! To lead up to it gradually might put less strain
upon one&rsquo;s understanding of what the artist intends. What do
you think of it? Speak! Say, my friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His excitement, as he watched Joan studying the picture
through narrowed eyes, was childlike in its eager expectancy.
But it was a full minute before she gave him any satisfaction.
Then she merely said, with what appeared to be a quiet sincerity,
&ldquo;Yes. It is <i>good</i>. What do you suppose he used to get that
tone in the white? Yet I don&rsquo;t quite see the point of the introduction
of the figure. I&rsquo;m distressed for the unity, Michael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no. See! It is like this&mdash;&rdquo; The big man was off
on a technical exposition of a new, a more subtle idea of unity,
as discovered and used by Gregory Clare. &ldquo;As for the way he
got that white&mdash;well, Charlie Frye has told me in the most
particular detail how Clare mixed his paints,&mdash;but only God
knows how he moved the brush to get such effects!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do not expand, Joan!&rdquo; he halted his dissertation to
expostulate. &ldquo;You are not convinced?&rdquo; Hugh was afraid that
the Russian might burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I am convinced that here we have something really
important!&rdquo; Joan admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! You <i>do</i>.&rdquo; He rubbed his hands. &ldquo;Well, that is enough!
All that I expect from anybody for the next hundred years or
so. After that, we shall see! But there will be those, my friend,
who will not admit even so much. You are aware of the stupidity
abounding, particularly here in your New York. I should
like to keep those stupid ones alive a few centuries, though, just
to show them up to themselves. They are going to insist how
the work of this painter is sentimental because of his insistence
on the introduction of the dancer. Clare sentimental! A man
who paints rocks like that, sees them like that! It is obvious that
he is as hard as the rocks he paints. Spiritually hard and firm,
a chiseled-out soul. Sound, through and through, and <i>formed</i>!
Sentimental? Pff! But we will speak only technicalities, my
friend, when they begin that rumpus. We will answer them
with cold technicalities in their own jargon&mdash;for even there
we will have them. And a hundred years from now, they&rsquo;ll be
groveling, eating from our hands, as it were. Not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan replied nothing, but went on viewing the painting from
various angles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall buy you one, Joan,&rdquo; Schwankovsky promised her.
&ldquo;Not an oil, perhaps. What you want of the finished work you
will choose and invest in, yourself. At the exhibition. There I
would not influence you. But there&rsquo;s a sketch of the dancer
you&rsquo;d value. But no. That I must have myself. Life would be
unthinkable, lacking it! Ha! There&rsquo;s a pencil drawing of the
studio itself. It is beautiful. It has a perfection. And when one
realizes that the artist lived there all his painting years, and the
dancer with him, it becomes too poignant. Perhaps I shall give
you that one, Joan. It will ravish you. You will see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>All the while Hugh was studying Joan, with narrowed eyes,
much as she was studying &ldquo;Noon.&rdquo; He did not question her
sincerity in praising the work at which she had shrugged once.
That one grew in appreciation as well as in accomplishment he
knew very well. But he saw that she was still disturbed, even
angry, although she sought to hide it. Hugh&rsquo;s problem was:
was Joan angry with him or Ariel or her friend, Schwankovsky,
or with herself? He came to the conclusion that she was angry
with herself, and for the first time in his life he felt a motion
of pity toward this woman he loved. He wanted to say to her:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry because you have grown big enough to grasp
Gregory Clare&rsquo;s essential spirit. Be glad, darling! No one
blames you for changing. I have nothing to forgive you in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! Until this minute pity and magnanimity had been the
elements lacking in his tormenting love for Joan. Pray God
now that nothing more of poignancy be added to it until he
died!</p>
<p class="tb">Before he could be torn from Grandam, &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; and the attic
where he had found an atmosphere which was an amazement
and a delight to him, Michael Schwankovsky took Ariel straight
into his arms and kissed her forehead and her lips. &ldquo;We are
friends, my child,&rdquo; he informed her and the world at large,
&ldquo;for eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Hugh saw, somewhat against his will, that Ariel liked
Schwankovsky very much, and that his caresses neither surprised
nor embarrassed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span></h2>
<p>To-morrow, Saturday, Ariel (contrary to Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s
predictions) would have held her job and given satisfaction
for something over a week, and she was to have a holiday.
Grandam had decided that one entire day free, rather than
the two afternoons which had been Miss Peters&rsquo;, would afford
Ariel more of a break and give her a chance to begin getting
acquainted with New York. Having a job now and money of
her own, she could go ahead at this without loss of pride.</p>
<p>Ariel was finishing getting Grandam to bed for the night.
It was nearly midnight. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really like leaving you to-morrow,&rdquo;
she was protesting. &ldquo;If Mrs. Ridelle doesn&rsquo;t show up
in the morning I shan&rsquo;t be sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she always does. She never fails. And you are to get
right out and away the minute we have had breakfast. You&rsquo;re
free until midnight. Don&rsquo;t even come in to say good night
to me. It&rsquo;s a totally free day. I want it that way. My only word
of advice is, wear both your slippers home when you do come,
and be in bed at the stroke of twelve. But your overshoes will
secure the slippers.&mdash;This is probably the last snowfall we&rsquo;ll
have this year.&rdquo; The soft thud of big flakes sounded constantly
on the glass of the panes at the back of the faintly flowered curtains.
The sound was lovely to Ariel. It was whiteness and stillness
made sensible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>But there came almost the same soft thud on the door, as
Ariel was about to pull back the curtains, open the windows
and let in the snowy night. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; Grandam murmured.
&ldquo;But go see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel opened the door into the brightly lighted attic hall.
Nothing there. She stepped out, feeling eerie. Then she saw
who had knocked. It was Anne Weyman, in hat and coat
just as she had come from the station, pressed back against
the wall, out of sight of Grandam&rsquo;s bed. In the glaring overhead
light she looked ghastly. &ldquo;Ariel Clare,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see you. How soon can you sneak down to my
room? No one but Rose knows I&rsquo;m home, and I don&rsquo;t want
they should. Rose said you were up here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come down at all,&rdquo; Ariel whispered back. &ldquo;I have
to keep in touch with Grandam&rsquo;s bell, you see. I&rsquo;m in Miss
Peters&rsquo; place. Did you know? But go on into my bedroom and
I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute. Or don&rsquo;t you want to speak to
Grandam first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Absolutely. Don&rsquo;t tell her I&rsquo;m here, or anything. Only
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel shut the door and returned to her final night duties.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something for me. Very important,&rdquo; she told Grandam.
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t tell you. You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam let her finish and go off to her own room without
a single question, or even any show of surprise; she was a person
wise in her incuriosities. Going, Ariel shut all the doors
between herself and Grandam. The electric bell in the side of
Grandam&rsquo;s bed made that reasonably safe, and in any case it
was always done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Anne was lying across Ariel&rsquo;s bed, still in her coat though her
hat had been thrown on the floor, sobbing. Ariel sat down on
the edge of the bed and tried to get her attention, but the wild
sobbing only increased. She knew nothing farther to do but to
lie down beside her, throw an arm tight around her, bulky fur
coat and all, and press her cheek to the burning, drenched one.
She had never heard any one cry like this or felt such convulsions
of sobbing through a body. But her pity was more potent
than her surprise and shyness, and she pressed closer and closer,
holding Anne with a steady arm.</p>
<p>Then, gradually, as though quelled by that slender arm
which was so persistent in its steadiness and the cool cheek
pressed against her own, Anne&rsquo;s sobbing began to die away,
the convulsions to lessen, to stop altogether. After several minutes
of comparative quiet Anne disengaged herself from Ariel&rsquo;s
clasp and sat up. The rouge on her cheeks, if there had been
any, was soaked away. She was white, like a Pierrot, in spite
of all her weeping. When she began speaking, the natural
huskiness of her voice was roughened by past sobs into a raspingness
hardly human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Ariel! I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you, coming toward
you, wanting to get to you, hours and hours. Not any girl at
Smith. Not Mother. Nobody but you, Ariel! You are the only
one who can help me and keep me from killing myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel took Anne&rsquo;s words literally and believed them. She
knew that Anne was here for her to save from death. Why she
was the one who had to do it, didn&rsquo;t matter. It might be, however,
for the simple reason that she herself was simple enough
and real enough to be able to believe in the stark danger which
threatened Anne before it had been demonstrated by fulfillment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Tears were streaming down Anne&rsquo;s face, but she made no
more noise of crying and seemed unaware of the continuing
flood. So Ariel took her own handkerchief and wiped them as
they came, while Anne stared into nothingness. Now the minute
had come when Ariel was to have it out with Death on
Anne&rsquo;s account. Anne was moved away, out of the conflict.
Thus the blind stare, the stopped sobbing. And Ariel knew
Death when she was faced with it. Hadn&rsquo;t she gotten thoroughly
acquainted with its presence in the studio that last
week with her father, while it waited around to make its final
attack? And here it was, back again. Strong and stark as before.
However, there was some difference between Ariel&rsquo;s two
meetings with the dark wings. Before, they had hovered down
slowly, with every assurance of finding a resting place in the
studio, and been content to stir and rustle from corner to
corner, waiting their time. But to-night they were not so sure
of their prey, and not being sure, were insistent, beating, angry.</p>
<p>Ariel could not pretend to ignore them; but she took both
of Anne&rsquo;s hands in her own hands,&mdash;the hands that Doctor
Hazzard had found so firm after her first Death encounter.
They were every bit as firm now. Anne felt without doubt the
strength that the doctor had felt. &ldquo;What is the matter, Anne?
Tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The haggard dark eyes made an effort, focused on Ariel&rsquo;s
face. Then went blank again. And in their blank-dark Ariel
saw&mdash;was it a wild beating of black wings? &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Anne Weyman, stop staring like that. You&rsquo;ve got
to tell me what is the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne reacted, as if she were under hypnosis, which in fact
she was. The wings beat back and away in the depths of the
brown eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Prescott,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ended with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? What has happened? Go on. Tell me.&rdquo;
This was forced confidence, in all conscience, and well for
Anne that Ariel had no compunction about that. Indeed, she
no more hesitated in compelling Anne&rsquo;s confidence at this minute
than she would have hesitated to knock a child, in danger of
drowning, unconscious in order to save it. But the command in
Ariel&rsquo;s voice knocked Anne into consciousness, not out of it.
She began at once telling Ariel, coherently and with detail,
everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year,&rdquo; the ragged parrot-voice croaked out, &ldquo;I made up
my mind to be like other girls. I didn&rsquo;t see why I wasn&rsquo;t popular
in the way they were&mdash;with men, I mean. I wanted so much
to be. My roommate&mdash;and she&rsquo;s my best friend, too&mdash;said it
was because I was prudish. You can&rsquo;t be <i>prudish</i> if you want
invitations to fraternity dances and things. Patty told me how
she worked it. She said she&rsquo;d begun herself by not being very
keen on necking, but it grew on you. So she got a few dates
for me through her dates, and I went ahead, trying her plan
out. But it didn&rsquo;t work. I couldn&rsquo;t pretend well enough. And
then, of course, the dates didn&rsquo;t repeat. I didn&rsquo;t much mind,
for if popularity came that way it wasn&rsquo;t worth the price, I&rsquo;d
learned, you see. So I went in for Drama instead, and compensated
by trying to make my dent acting. And I got quite happy
again. Patty and I sort of drifted apart. But giving up the ambition
to be popular was like coming out of prison and I could
bear even losing Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all of a sudden, Ariel, the whole works went bang....
Because I met Prescott. And I had to laugh. For how can
you really let a man kiss you so it counts, until you&rsquo;re really
and truly crazy for him to kiss you? I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was no mere slang phrase. Anne was seriously asking
Ariel. And Ariel replied sharply, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, of course.
That&rsquo;s the whole secret; anybody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Anne laughed, if one could call it laughter. It was neither sob
nor speech, at any rate. And went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something tremendous
about wanting to be kissed like that. You don&rsquo;t know
whether it&rsquo;s pain or bliss. It&rsquo;s both, I guess, full up to the
brim of your heart, really.... When he touched my hand,
even by accident, it was like the world coming to an end. I
thought I&rsquo;d die of it. And it seemed to be like that with him
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty said I was coming along,&mdash;for I&rsquo;d won back her respect
again, attracting a man like Prescott. She warned me to be
careful, though. But there has never been any danger. It was
Prescott who was careful. So far as I was concerned he could
have had anything he wanted of me. Why not? After kisses
like that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t affect <i>him</i> that way I guess. Just his loving
me as much as he did was bliss. And I didn&rsquo;t want him to want
to marry me, after he explained to me his point of view on
marriage and I had read &lsquo;Stephen&rsquo;s Fall,&rsquo; and all. It wouldn&rsquo;t
have been Prescott, you see, married stodgily to a nice girl!
I was glad he was just himself and I was <i>proud</i> that he could
tell me frankly just how much he didn&rsquo;t care for me as well
as how much he did, if you know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ariel agreed. &ldquo;I do know. Loving a person doesn&rsquo;t
mean wanting to change them, even if changing them would
only mean their being able to love you better. You love them
because they are the way they are....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And listen.&mdash;The last two days of vacation here, Prescott
was different. Toward me, I mean. If he could manage
it, he wasn&rsquo;t alone with me. He&rsquo;d stick around Glenn or you,
or Mother. Any one! And he went for one walk all alone. Pretended
he didn&rsquo;t know I was waiting for him with my things
on in the library. Just slipped out without my knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was you that had changed him, Ariel. Imagine!
But then he did keep saying how graceful you are and
what lovely hair you&rsquo;ve got. And that last morning when he
went to sleep in the library&mdash;remember? That morning I
was <i>sure</i> that he was crazy about you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was pretty dumb not to see that it was Joan Nevin all
the time, from the first minute he saw her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he got back to New Haven, after his visit here, he
didn&rsquo;t write. He&rsquo;d written every day for months. I nearly went
insane watching for mail. I wrote him at first, pretending everything
was the same. But when he wouldn&rsquo;t answer, I began calling
him up on long distance. He was always out&mdash;they said.
I sent telegrams too. I hadn&rsquo;t any pride. Or I&rsquo;d have it one hour,
decide I&rsquo;d let eternal silence on my part show him how indifferent
I was, and the next <i>minute</i>, almost, I was calling long distance
again. It was wild, but I didn&rsquo;t seem to have any will.
Then, to-day, I couldn&rsquo;t stand it. I <i>had</i> to see him if he was
never going to answer the telephone, never write. So I cut
all my classes and went to New Haven. I&rsquo;d gone to classes right
along. Even studied. Patty never guessed anything, right in
the room with me! I didn&rsquo;t cry, not once. Till you came in
just now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I went right from the train to Prescott&rsquo;s dorm. And I met
him coming out of the street door. I had meant to go right
up to his room, unless somebody stopped me. But there he was&mdash;like
Fate. He took me away from the college into the town
to an awful, dirty little eating place, miles away. It seemed
miles. And all the time he talked. He said I was crazy and he
despised me for chasing him like that. He&rsquo;d made love to
dozens of girls and got through with them. But not one of them
had ever done a crazy thing like coming to his dormitory and
trying to throw a scene. Girls of my sort understood how much
necking meant with a man, and <i>how little</i>. If they didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d
written a book, to help them to, hadn&rsquo;t he! If a man of his sort
wanted something more serious than necking, he didn&rsquo;t usually
take it with the sisters of his best friends. Or with my kind of
girl at all. He thought I&rsquo;d understood that. I&rsquo;d pretended to
understand, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he talked like anything against Mother&mdash;sneered&mdash;kept
saying that in inviting him to visit us she&rsquo;d tacitly admitted
that she expected me to be able to take care of myself. Or
hadn&rsquo;t she believed in the sincerity of &lsquo;Stephen&rsquo;s Fall&rsquo;? She
had read it, hadn&rsquo;t she? Well, then&mdash;and so on! He said
that she, Mother, expected to have her cake and eat it too.
That she didn&rsquo;t think straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it had come to him here at Wild Acres that in spite
of Mother&rsquo;s and my stupidity, he didn&rsquo;t want to go on fooling
along with his best friend&rsquo;s sister any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grabbed his hands. We were in the tearoom. They were
building a house out of matches. He has marvelous hands, do
you remember? Just looking at them stops your heart,&mdash;my
heart. He pulled them away, and there mine lay, flat, on the
tablecloth. I looked at them and looked at them. They seemed
to have dropped off from my arms and be just lying there, you
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t even look at me any more. His face was all
twisted&mdash;snarly. Loathing me. I left my hands on the table
and said over and over, &lsquo;I love you. I love you. What has Glenn
got to do with it? Or Mother? I&rsquo;ll take all the responsibility.
You&rsquo;re afraid, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter. You&rsquo;re afraid of Glenn.
And Mother. Afraid.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;He got even angrier. He said, &lsquo;Be quiet. Glenn Weyman&rsquo;s
friendship means more to me than necking with a dozen girls
like you, or a hundred. How couldn&rsquo;t it! He has a mind I respect.
He&rsquo;s a person. A contemporary I value. He means something
in my life and always will, I hope. And of course, I&rsquo;m not
afraid of him. He isn&rsquo;t the sort to let me down because I&rsquo;ve
kissed his sister a few times without matrimonial intentions.
Not Glenn. Hugh&rsquo;s in that class, perhaps. Hugh might raise
a rumpus, even now, when we haven&rsquo;t done anything. So what
if we <i>had</i>? Doesn&rsquo;t that scare <i>you</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he didn&rsquo;t suppose I was capable of understanding
how much more real satisfaction it was to him to spend his
time with a person like Glenn than to waste it dabbling for
hours with me on the edge of a <i>slough of sentimentality tainted
with sensuality</i>. The economical and fastidious thing, he said,
was for him to take his intellectual companionship where he
could find it, with fellows like Glenn, and when he wanted a
girl he&rsquo;d do what Stephen did before he lost his soul and married
the nice daughter of his president.... Yes, Ariel. He said
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;If I ever do fall romantically in love, it would have
to be with a developed personality, a real woman. Some one
who has a life of her own, and to whom our passion would be
just an incident of that life, not a fulfillment. <i>Some one like
Mrs. Nevin.</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I knew. It was Joan had done it all to him. Some of
the very things he had said, she had said first, and he was just
quoting. I <i>knew</i>....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;He took a bill out of his pocketbook and pushed it all
mussed up into my hand. &lsquo;You pay. I&rsquo;m going,&rsquo; he said. I was
dizzy. He hated even to look at me. He got up and walked out
of the tearoom. I hadn&rsquo;t poured the tea. The toast hadn&rsquo;t been
uncovered. I put the money down on my plate and walked out
too. Walking to the door was like walking in the dark. I
couldn&rsquo;t see. Felt my way among the chairs. But when I got
into the street the faintness went. I must have run, for I caught
up with Prescott down the block. I took his arm. He jumped
as if a leper had come and taken his arm, almost off the curb.
But I got his hand. He hit me then, I think, and started to run.
Whether there were other people on the street or not, I don&rsquo;t
know. Must have been, though. After a while, I saw a taxi
driver looking at me funnily. He was drawn up by the curb.
He said, &lsquo;Buck up. It&rsquo;s a great life, kid, if you don&rsquo;t weaken.&rsquo;
He was fine. I liked him. He took me to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought a ticket for Northampton. But I was really headed
for the Connecticut. I was crazy to get down to a place I know&mdash;a
place he and I had often been&mdash;where the water is deep,
and I could slide off into the blackness under the ice. I didn&rsquo;t
think of Mother or Glenn or Hugh or Grandam or Patty or
any one. I didn&rsquo;t even think about death. I only wanted to slip
off under the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sometime, after a long time, you came, Ariel, like a
picture on the air. You, and your green feather! I remembered
how you had lost your father. I&rsquo;d never taken it in before,
but I did then, on the train. You had lost him and I had lost
Prescott. And then for the first time I knew that I was crazy,
and that my wanting to get into the black water was part of
the craziness. But your green feather was not part of it. It was
the other direction, away from craziness. I don&rsquo;t understand
about that. But it was the Connecticut for me, or to go where
the green feather was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I came home on the first train. And now the craziness
has gone.... Every word I&rsquo;ve said to you, Ariel, has been
driving it away. Just looking at you drives it away. But I don&rsquo;t
see where your feather comes in, do you? Is it still on your hat?
Safe in the closet? There&rsquo;s something&mdash;<i>deep</i>&mdash;about that,
that I don&rsquo;t see....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Ariel wiped the tears from Anne&rsquo;s face; for although
she had come back into occupation of her mentality, she was
still almost beyond physical sensation, and did not even know
she was crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say our prayers,&rdquo; Ariel said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we can do. I
don&rsquo;t understand about the green feather any more than you.
But God is in it somewhere&mdash;and my darling father, for it&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s feather. Persis and Nicky think it&rsquo;s a magic feather&mdash;but
I guess there&rsquo;s something better than magic about it now....
Deeper ... though we <i>don&rsquo;t</i> understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They knelt beside the bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span></h2>
<p>Anne was waked by Ariel putting the breakfast tray
down on the bed beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello. It&rsquo;s morning. This is my day off, Anne, and I&rsquo;m
going for a long walk up towards Scarborough. If you want to
slip out with me and walk too, nobody would know, it&rsquo;s so
early, and then you could get back to college this afternoon,
couldn&rsquo;t you? Want to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when did you get up? Have you had your breakfast?
You&rsquo;re a good bedfellow, Ariel. You didn&rsquo;t stir all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, neither did you, or I wasn&rsquo;t awake to know if you
did. I had breakfast with Grandam. But I haven&rsquo;t told her
that you&rsquo;re here, since you asked me not to. Rose maneuvered
this tray for me. She&rsquo;s a good sport, isn&rsquo;t she! Grandam is
too. She must wonder who came to the door last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sport yourself now that we&rsquo;re on the subject,
Ariel. A darned good one.... Many thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still snowing. But one couldn&rsquo;t believe in the reality
of it, somehow: April was so close behind. This was a mere
flurry in her face, ephemeral. The whole landscape was ablow
with snow clusters, like flowers, like the flowers on Grandam&rsquo;s
curtains masking the night from her room. So this flower-blowing-curtain
shut out spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Why Anne was pushing her way through this dream of
snow blobs, shoulder to shoulder with Ariel, on a tramp up
the Post Road, she hardly knew. It was Ariel&rsquo;s will that was
motivating her, perhaps. She felt that Ariel&rsquo;s will&mdash;or somebody&rsquo;s,
not her own anyway&mdash;had steered even her dreams last
night. And hadn&rsquo;t Ariel undressed her, and brushed her hair
and put her to bed like a baby? Anne thought that she had.
And she was still giving the same sort of service.</p>
<p>For the first hour, or more, the girls scarcely spoke. Anne did
at one time call, &ldquo;Wait a minute, Ariel. I&rsquo;ve got snow in my
ankle.&rdquo; And Ariel, who had not noticed that Anne had dropped
back, turned and retraced her steps to her.</p>
<p>And soon after that Ariel had exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wood
road! Look how the boughs are tangled over it. It&rsquo;s like a white
cloister! Where do you suppose it goes?&rdquo; They had followed
it, thrilled, up hill through woods until it ended in a high
meadow of trackless snow. It may have disappointed Ariel, that
snow meadow, after the mysterious woods, but it brought a
kind of psychic relief to Anne. Its bare expanse simplified her,
was the last touch to Ariel&rsquo;s own simplifying influence. Silently,
with something of the snow&rsquo;s own silence, they returned
to the road and trudged on and on, like two sturdy ponies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Anne began to be aware that with every increase of weariness
to her trudging legs and feet a bit of mental misery petered out,
got dropped off. Her mind, after a while, even began to function
again. Since the moment when Prescott had struck her&mdash;and
run away from her on the New Haven street, her mind
had played almost no part in her actions, at least her conscious
mind hadn&rsquo;t. As she went on beside silent Ariel, suddenly, unaccountably,
she recalled an incident of one of her summers
at the shore. She was at the extreme outer edge of a dock
when a sloop emerged from thick fog before her very face,
as if it had taken its form and motion from the mists themselves.
And now it seemed to her that her thoughts&mdash;the
vehicle, that is, that made up her thought-feeling-self&mdash;was
such a sloop, sailing toward her out of a foggy nothingness,
coming clear, taking shape. But then there must be something
else, something detached from self, that could see self returning&mdash;and
indeed, something for self to return to. Any instant now
the two would merge. The sloop would slide alongside the dock,
and self would step into self. And when she did join this self,
taking form and moving swiftly upon her now after absence,
would she lose the present sense of detachment? Would she
be whole again&mdash;less of self-consciousness and more of self?</p>
<p>But by now physical weariness had increased to a point which
seemed final. If she dragged her feet another step forward
through the sticky snow her legs would snap off at the hips.
She came to a dead halt, too exhausted even to get onto the
side of the road out of the path of possible motors. &ldquo;Ariel!&rdquo; she
called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done up. Now what do you want? What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s tone and the words themselves sounded hopeless, and
certainly her physical self was hopeless. But in the instant of
giving in to sheer physical defeat she had also given in to an
eerie kind of delight of the spirit. She knew that good was
coming, coming, coming, creaming up toward her from every
side into a surf of light in her heart.</p>
<p>Ariel turned back to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired too,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;How
far have we come, do you suppose? Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred miles or so, and we can&rsquo;t be any distance at all
from Scarborough, if it&rsquo;s still on the map and not taking a holiday.
If we can win on to that burg we can get a snack to
eat and then catch a local to New York. But why aren&rsquo;t there
any automobiles out? Too thick a storm? If we could get
picked up! What was exactly your idea, anyway, in this form
of recreation, Ariel? I&rsquo;m just begun to get brains enough to
inquire into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, myself,&rdquo; Ariel murmured. &ldquo;Only, after last
night, you know, I had to walk, run, or swim. It was the only
way to&mdash;to uncoil it from me. Let&rsquo;s start on and pray for a
motor to come along, a kind one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But very soon they got their second wind. Their legs still
felt that they might break off at hip or knee, but this had
gradually become only an interesting sensation, for their bodies
as units began to discount the thousands of separate fatigue
messages sent by separate nerves and had grown beautifully
light. The girls were moving ahead now&mdash;on, on, on, with
no need to whip up their wills. If they should learn that they
must walk on like this until night they would not rebel. And
they began talking as freely as without effort they walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean about uncoiling it&mdash;all that last
night&rsquo;s stuff,&rdquo; Anne exclaimed. &ldquo;Every step uncoils me. But I
feel, Ariel, as if my feet must leave a trail of slimy sticky awfulness
behind me in the snow. Only why should you need to
uncoil, Ariel? You weren&rsquo;t going to slide down into the dark
water to slip out under the ice. <i>You</i> hadn&rsquo;t separated from
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But you&rsquo;d always horrified me a little. I felt that you
were trapped in some dangerous, dreadful way, when I first
saw you. And last night it all got real for me. It&rsquo;s more than as
if you&rsquo;d told me, Anne. It&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;d been in your trap with
you and had wanted to die too&mdash;and all. I can&rsquo;t explain myself.
But it&rsquo;s all uncoiling now, every step we take, and the
snow is blotting it up. Don&rsquo;t you feel it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life is strange, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; Anne observed, with as fresh a
wonder as though the idea itself were fresh. &ldquo;Do you know, I
hardly was aware of <i>you</i> at all during vacation except toward
the last, when I hated you so. Before that I only thought of you
in your relation with Hugh. I thought it a pity you weren&rsquo;t
colorful enough to make some sort of a stab at cutting Joan
out with him. Not colorful! Stupid, even! Imagine! And now I
know that you&rsquo;re the best thing in the Weyman family, except,
possibly, Grandam. But you and Grandam might be sisters.
No, not family&mdash;race! You are beings of the same race.
That&rsquo;s it. The angel race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush! How idiotic!&rdquo; Ariel wasn&rsquo;t flattered. She was
humiliated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ariel! Have you ever been in love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. As much as you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much? But not like me, I know. You&rsquo;ve never been
lost. You haven&rsquo;t been what Prescott said I was&mdash;eaten into by
love as though love was a cancer and a destruction. He said that
the people who let it take them like that were disgusting slaves,
and not worth anybody&rsquo;s loving. He was right. My love was
cancerous, not beautiful. You know, yourself. You saw it without
understanding it and you say it horrified you. Then no
wonder Prescott was put off by it. But it&rsquo;s not like that with
you. I can sense things as well as you can, you see! You&rsquo;ve
stayed yourself, kept the integrity of your personality. And your
pride. I know it. You&rsquo;re pure, clear like a diamond. And by
&lsquo;pure&rsquo; I mean your will is untouched. Unsmirched. Diamond-hard
and diamond-clean. Aren&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Ariel responded nothing. And after a while Anne went on,
urging her confidence: &ldquo;Do you suppose Joan and Prescott have
something alike in them? They&rsquo;re both so finished, complete
in themselves! That&rsquo;s the sort of person real people love, isn&rsquo;t
it! How can you expect to be loved if you&rsquo;re not living your
own life but all the time trying to break through into another
person&rsquo;s life instead? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to do with
Prescott. He said so. If I&rsquo;d any authentic life of my own, then
he mightn&rsquo;t have got scared at my loving him too much. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have such terrifying potentialities for being a limpet....
And isn&rsquo;t that the trouble between Joan and Hugh! I bet
it is! She&rsquo;s complete, finished without him. Authentic! And
Hugh&mdash;Poor dear! He&rsquo;s always trying to break through into
that authentic, completed circle. If he&rsquo;d only make a circle of
his own and then loop it on to hers, there might be a chance
for a happy relation between them. But what he&rsquo;s concentrating
on is not the harmony in his own psyche, but to storm the
harmony in hers. He isn&rsquo;t fit for love&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not going
to pity Hugh now any more than I pity myself, please God.
Neither of us is fit to be loved, or we would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then she noticed Ariel&rsquo;s face, and was silenced as if by a
thunder-clap, although Ariel&rsquo;s face was as quiet as a stone and
shut like a stone. Still, Anne was awed or frightened&mdash;she
didn&rsquo;t know which&mdash;into sudden silence.</p>
<p>After a while Ariel begged, as if Anne hadn&rsquo;t so carefully
shut up, as if she had gone right on with this subject of Hugh
and Joan for the last completely silent half mile or so, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
say such things about Hugh. They aren&rsquo;t so at all. But, oh,
Anne! Let us never try to break through and lose ourselves
in any one&mdash;unless God. That&rsquo;s the way to be free. Let&rsquo;s run.&mdash;Let&rsquo;s
never be slaves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hand in hand the two girls went plunging along the road
until they staggered to a stop, winded. Then, laughing, breathlessly,
they kissed each other on the mouth, kissed through the
snow, their faces soaked and cold with the snow-flower blobs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIX</span></h2>
<p>Hugh, who had failed in an effort to discover Ariel&rsquo;s
whereabouts on her first &ldquo;Saturday off&rdquo; and make a real holiday
for her in New York as he had intended, spoke for the
following Saturday by the middle of the week. But he was
too late. It was already promised to Joan. This surprised him
and made him uneasy. He had lost his hope for Joan&rsquo;s sympathy
with Ariel days ago, and now he was past desiring it.
For Ariel and Joan, he had come to see, were essentially antithetical.
Ariel had been wiser than he in knowing it from
the beginning. So it gave him no particular pleasure to learn
that Joan was taking Ariel to a Boston Symphony concert, and
afterwards to dine at Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Even in Grandam&rsquo;s apartment it was not easy to see much
of Ariel. For when he went up there, evenings, she tactfully
left him alone with his grandmother. Monday night when he
had protested, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come to see you too,&rdquo; she had surprisingly
explained that she wanted to write a letter to Anne and
would come back if she finished it. But she had not come
back. And why was she writing to Anne? So far as Hugh
knew, Anne had paid literally no attention to Ariel at all when
Hugh had wanted her to, during the holidays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Of Joan these days it appeared that he could see as much as
he liked, but in most unsatisfactory ways. He found himself
hovering on the edges of her hospitality to watch her dance
and gossip with her kaleidoscopically shifting groups of intimates.
From an entire evening spent in thus shadowing her
he might be the richer for only one or two alluring but enigmatical
glances, or if he was supremely lucky, a few minutes of
one-sided intercourse, when Joan drew him out about his business
and his own progress, and he waked too late to realize
that he had not entered into her world of interests nor been
encouraged to do so.</p>
<p>To stay away from her altogether would be best. How often
he had come to this conclusion! But he was incapable of counting
the cost of his love; or at least incapable of acting frugally,
once he had counted it. If Joan wanted his friendship, she should
have as much of it as she requested. And who would not rather
die of starvation one day than go all one&rsquo;s life without an appetite?</p>
<p>While hungering for Joan, Hugh thought much of Ariel.
The time when she had been a responsibility peculiarly his
seemed passing. For Grandam, Schwankovsky, and now even
Joan appeared, suddenly, all inside of a few days, ready, even
eager, to assume it on their own accounts. And twice already
since Monday Hugh had seen Anne&rsquo;s writing on envelopes
addressed to Ariel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>One morning in the next week, Hugh called Brenda Loring
on the telephone from his office to invite her to lunch
with him. This girl, who from his first meeting with her had
made it plain that he interested her, was an interior decorator
with an astonishing vogue, considering her age and experience.
It was only two or three years since she had graduated
from Vassar, and already she had palatial offices of her own
on Fifth Avenue, a dozen or more eager assistants, and an
income which must be several times the size of Hugh&rsquo;s. Joan
had had a hand in her success. But Miss Loring had been
worthy of that patronage, and now she was beyond need of it.</p>
<p>Hugh could not fail to be gratified by the pleasure which
colored Miss Loring&rsquo;s voice when she discovered what he
wanted of her, and by her quick acceptance of his luncheon
invitation, given in spite of the fact that she must break a
previously made engagement. He had been rather driven to
seeking feminine companionship to-day because he was feeling
particularly lonely and at loose ends. The reasons were
various and not all of them plain even to himself. The uppermost
one seemed to be, however, that it was Ariel&rsquo;s birthday
and that everybody appeared to have known it, except himself.
Joan had, at any rate, and she had bargained with
Grandam for Ariel to have a half-holiday in which to celebrate
it. A party had been arranged and Hugh not been included.
Joan had made an attempt at explaining this anomaly
by telling him that the party was really Schwankovsky&rsquo;s whole
plan and expense, and that she was not in a position to suggest
the guests.&mdash;And now Hugh was taking Miss Loring to lunch.</p>
<p>He went to her offices to pick her up and suggest that she
choose the restaurant. At once she said, &ldquo;The Jade Swan.&rdquo; It
was in the Village, she explained, but rather beyond anything
the Village had ever produced before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent, in fact. Every one&rsquo;s trying it, but it will be
my first try, Hugh. I&rsquo;m going to call you Hugh, now that
you&rsquo;ve at last begun to bother about me, and of course I&rsquo;m
Brenda. And let&rsquo;s have a table in the balcony where we can
see the whole circus. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of celebrities to stare
at. Writers&mdash;artists&mdash;editors. But just the terribly successful
ones. The other sort couldn&rsquo;t afford it, poor dears!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>There were only half a dozen tables in the balcony, and
Hugh and his guest were lucky in securing the last of these.
It stood against the railing and afforded a view of the entire
main floor of the restaurant. All the tables down there were
already occupied in spite of the newness of the place, except
one in the very center, which had the appearance of being reserved
for some particularly festive occasion. For while the
other tables all had their centerpieces of poets&rsquo; narcissus, this
table flaunted a big shallow jade bowl filled with orchids and
white roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little bouquet cost somebody a fortune,&rdquo; Brenda murmured.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not only expensive. It&rsquo;s lovely. It&rsquo;ll be interesting
to see whom it&rsquo;s to honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And almost simultaneously Hugh knew who had ordered it
and in whose honor, for Schwankovsky&rsquo;s big voice boomed
under the balcony beneath their feet, and he and his party entered
from the street. Ariel and Joan, and a frail blond young
man, made up the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. Honestly I didn&rsquo;t know they were coming
here,&rdquo; Hugh exclaimed.</p>
<p>His companion laughed merrily. &ldquo;But of course you didn&rsquo;t.
Did you think I was suspecting you of shadowing Joan Nevin,
dear fellow? Wasn&rsquo;t it I who chose the place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Joan had seated herself facing the balcony; but in spite of
the concentrated gaze of all the balcony lunchers on herself
and her friends she did not look up or appear to be aware that
there was a balcony. Hugh realized, as freshly, almost, as if
he had never done so before, how distinguished and unusual
as well as beautiful Joan was. Her face glowed with a purpose
and light no other face in that crowded room possessed.
Perhaps it was the effect of the brilliant large eyes set wide
under the coppery-winged sweep of her brows. To-day the
burnished hair was concealed under a purple hat so <i>&agrave; la mode</i>
that not a glimmer of it showed at brow or cheek. Few women
could wear a hat so daring as that and preserve at the same
time a radiant and feminine beauty. And when Joan spoke,
leaning across the table toward Ariel, her lips moved with
such beauty of precision that one, without need to hear, knew
that her enunciation was perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! Joan Nevin is a stunning creature,&rdquo; Brenda ejaculated,
all her special gift of taste behind the generous words.
&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s the great Michael Schwankovsky who invested in the
floral piece. Well, if any one in New York can afford it with
the stock market what it is, I suppose he can. Big blustering
Midas! And it&rsquo;s Joan he&rsquo;s blustering around to-day. But that&rsquo;s
quite on the books, isn&rsquo;t it? The little man, the poor dear, is
Charlie Frye. Nobody of any importance, but amiable, and
surprisingly often seen in company with the great. The other
person&mdash;&rdquo; Brenda assumed her lorgnette, a property she used
with discretion and undeniable distinction for one so young,&mdash;&ldquo;The
other person&mdash;Lady? Child? Flapper? Russian
Princess? Can&rsquo;t make out <i>what</i> she is, and I don&rsquo;t know who
she is. Funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ariel Clare. And the party&rsquo;s in her honor, not Joan&rsquo;s.
Because it&rsquo;s her birthday,&rdquo; Hugh informed his companion&mdash;diffidently.</p>
<p>Ariel, thin of cheek and shoulders, emerging with Frye&rsquo;s
help at this instant from her coat of a princess, was pale and
small in contrast with the radiant Joan. Meager. Thin. Grandam
was certainly&mdash;Hugh was sure of it&mdash;letting her work far too
hard. And so this was Charlie Frye!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>But what was Brenda Loring saying with so much animation
as she waved a presumptuously impatient waiter back
from Hugh&rsquo;s elbow. &ldquo;Not really! Ariel Clare! The dancer! But
how too deliciously interesting to have this early view of her,
ahead of the mob. Getting within radius of Joan, though, is as
good as being behind the scenes, isn&rsquo;t it! She&rsquo;s so frightfully
in on everything! But this time you&rsquo;ve beat Joan. You know
the model intimately. She works for you, doesn&rsquo;t she? Joan&rsquo;s
awfully entertaining on the subject. She declares it&rsquo;s so typical&mdash;your
keeping the girl on in that position at Wild Acres
now that Schwankovsky himself is her patron, and the exhibition&rsquo;s
going to make her famous. Joan thinks your Philistinism
delightful. But of course you&rsquo;re not so insensible as Joan fondly
imagines! I should see through you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was talking to the blond young man, while he visibly
gloried in her radiance. &ldquo;But the radiance is all in herself,&rdquo;
Hugh thought, looking down on the scene, and for once in
his life thinking about Joan objectively, as a stranger might.
Ever since she had come into the restaurant it had been as if
he were at a play, and the four people sitting around the center
table down there the players, to criticize impersonally and make
what one could of. &ldquo;Yes, that radiance is all enclosed. It doesn&rsquo;t
light Frye&rsquo;s way to her, help him forward. It&rsquo;s not sympathy.
Not really. Now Ariel, although she&rsquo;s silent and no one is looking
at her, throws a radiance out from herself, all about her.
She stays dim. One hardly thinks of her. But if Frye turned
now from Joan to her, he&rsquo;d find an illumination in the air
between them. <i>Sympathy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>He speculated about Schwankovsky. Had he tenderness for
Ariel&rsquo;s self, which was so poignantly accessible? Or was it
merely self-dramatization in the big creature that had thrown
him to his knees at her feet when she came into the drawing-room
at Wild Acres that Sunday afternoon? Well, if he had
been genuine then&mdash;and Hugh thought he was probably
much too egocentric for that to be possible&mdash;his enthusiasm
seemed to have dwindled since, for he had looked only at Joan
all this time, listened to her speaking first to Ariel, then to
Frye, openly absorbed in her and proud of her. Hugh wondered
what he meant to do with Ariel the rest of the afternoon,
now that he had usurped her birthday, if this was the
extent of his interest in her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll excuse myself and go down
and find out,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ll hand her over to
me after lunch. She&rsquo;ll like seeing the office, I think, and our
view of the Battery. She can wait while I finish up the absolutely
necessary business, and then we can walk in the Park,
or go to an exhibition, or do anything she&rsquo;d like. Joan and
Schwankovsky can&rsquo;t, after all, enjoy playing around with any
one so simple and outside all their interests! My taking her on
will be a relief to them, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But with the next breath his plan and his hope were shattered.
For Schwankovsky suddenly turned to Ariel, until now
so unnoticed beside him, and put his great, hairy hand close
down on hers, which lay on the white cloth, and they smiled
at each other. It was over in an instant but it told Hugh all
that he had doubted of understanding and sympathy between
those two. Hugh perceived now&mdash;turned almost clairvoyant
for the instant&mdash;that although Schwankovsky might look at
Joan and listen to her, world without end, Ariel was all the
while in his heart, and that he was as aware of her as&mdash;yes,
as a mother is aware of the child in her arms while she converses
with a caller.... So again Ariel had no need of Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>He returned his attention to Miss Loring, and tried to respond
to something she had been saying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly see
why Joan should be amused at Ariel&rsquo;s having a job and sticking
at it, until the exhibition, anyway,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s funny
about that, Miss&mdash;I mean Brenda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, if it were a respectable job, of course. But the
idea was, you see, her being a maid. An odd coat, that, for a
maid to be wearing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but she isn&rsquo;t a servant. She&rsquo;s my grandmother&rsquo;s
companion-nurse, and doing it very well too! You misunderstood
Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Brenda had turned around in her chair, and
continuing to pretend that the impatient waiter did not exist,
looked down at Ariel with clever, narrowed eyes. Then she
laughed, a keen little ripple of pure pleasure, and continuing
to squint through her lorgnette at the unconscious Ariel, cried
softly, &ldquo;But I do begin to see&mdash;something in her, anyway. <i>The
dancer.</i> A cerise veil, a straight, very short purple tunic. Sheer.
Neck, arms, legs, bare. That clean line of shoulder blade and
thigh.... The face doesn&rsquo;t matter, you know, in dancing.
<i>It&rsquo;s the body.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The dancer!</i> What do you mean?&rdquo; Hugh was suddenly as
much revolted by Brenda&rsquo;s narrowed, discerning eyes taking
Ariel in from her head to her feet as he had been revolted a
minute ago by Schwankovsky&rsquo;s hand swallowing Ariel&rsquo;s on the
white tablecloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Brenda dropped her lorgnette and looked across at Hugh,
surprised by his tone. &ldquo;Of course. The dancer. Why not?
Joan&rsquo;s crowd are saying it now. But soon all the world will be
shouting it,&mdash;if Schwankovsky is right, and the Clare pictures
are all that he thinks them. Isn&rsquo;t this Ariel in every one
of them, dancing? Isadora Duncan stuff? May Morning stuff?
Well, there&rsquo;s all the publicity she needs, if she wants to go
on the stage, whether she has any actual talent or not. They
say she&rsquo;s untrained. But a few weeks of hard work would fix
that. &AElig;sthetic dancing doesn&rsquo;t require the technique that ballet
requires, you know, or even the vaudeville dancing stunts.
All that is necessary is a reasonably pretty body, some gracefulness,
and a lot of feeling. Given these, and a cerise veil, that
girl down there can go as far as she likes&mdash;providing her
father&rsquo;s paintings make a big enough stir. Haven&rsquo;t you even
thought of that, Hugh? After all, the girl&rsquo;s in your house, no
matter in what capacity. You might get just a little interested,
I should think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh peremptorily beckoned the waiter, by now almost
hopeless, and took up the matter of their lunch with him.
After the business was settled to Brenda&rsquo;s complete satisfaction,
and even more to the waiter&rsquo;s, whose respect for Hugh
showed to almost a shocking degree in his face as he received his
orders, Hugh asked, &ldquo;Did Joan put this nonsense into your
head, or Schwankovsky? Anyway, it is utterest nonsense.&rdquo; He
could not disguise from himself, and even less from Miss Loring,
that he was angry and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? About Ariel Clare? Really, I don&rsquo;t remember. Why,
it&rsquo;s so obvious I may even have thought of it myself,&rdquo; Brenda
retorted, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Hugh,&rdquo; she went on, still teasingly, &ldquo;that you yourself
have had one of these Clare pictures for years, the best
one at that, the gem of them all, according to Schwankovsky,
in your attic? And did Schwankovsky and Joan and Ariel go
on a still hunt for its recovery? And is it now hanging in your
grandmother&rsquo;s bedroom, because there&rsquo;s no other place you
want it at Wild Acres? Or are they only making a good story?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; Hugh replied seriously. &ldquo;Except that Ariel
got the picture out herself when she came to us, without help.
By the time Schwankovsky had looked her up at Wild Acres,
it was hung over my grandmother&rsquo;s mantel. But it belongs to
Ariel now, because I&rsquo;ve given it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda stopped laughing. She looked at Hugh with new
seriousness and exclaimed, &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;m really, in my
heart of hearts, quite different from Joan and from most of
the women she plays with. I&rsquo;m willing to have all the cultivation
myself, and not expect my men friends to play up to all
that.... Art, you know. Taste. It doesn&rsquo;t matter so much as
one thinks! And I don&rsquo;t believe that we so-called artistic
people have all the imagination, either. Men like you, business
men, your imagination is the real thing. You create something
out of nothing. Fortunes out of ideas. Skyscrapers out of
thin air. Who am I to laugh when you show bad taste in judging
a painting or prefer jazz to Debussy? One can&rsquo;t have things
both ways. And your way looks to me to be the biggest, truly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schwankovsky, for instance, is an entertaining person, and
he certainly has cultivated his taste to an extraordinary and
sure degree, and he&rsquo;s done a whole lot for art in our benighted
country. But he inherited his millions. His imagination never
had to go into the making of <i>them</i>. Only in the spending. He
uses his imagination in the spending, you in the making. Nobody
would have time to do both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to bet quite a lot, Hugh, that you in this
particular case are the one who&rsquo;s right. Not about the picture.
Schwankovsky&rsquo;s more likely to be right about that. But about
the girl. Your genius must be in sizing up people. All business
men, successful ones, have to be able to size up people. That&rsquo;s
obvious. And if you see that Ariel Clare is just a simple, wholesome
girl who happened to have an artist for a father, but herself
is a type to make a good nurse or maid, something practical
and useful, then I think you&rsquo;re right in sticking to it and being
disgusted at the idea of Joan and her friend Schwankovsky
thinking they can make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear....
I&rsquo;d accept your judgment on a person much quicker than anybody&rsquo;s
down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved her cigarette in its long holder in the direction
of the Schwankovsky party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you <i>ever</i> in your life tasted such onion soup?&rdquo; she
murmured after a minute of rather stunned silence on Hugh&rsquo;s
part. &ldquo;How old is she, by the way? To become a dancer one
should start very young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ariel, you mean? Yes, the soup is very good. She&rsquo;s twenty
to-day. It&rsquo;s her birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Hugh said this, Ariel caught sight of him for the first
time, and smiled up at the balcony. He bowed to her, and his
own smile was rather constrained. But he felt that a finger of
sunshine had suddenly traversed his heart. He said again, not
realizing that he was repeating himself, &ldquo;To-day is her birthday.
She is twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XX</span></h2>
<p>Joan telephoned Hugh the next morning early and asked
him to pick her up at Holly if he was driving to town that day.
This was not an unusual request, but for all its usualness Hugh
never failed to be delightedly surprised to the point of suddenly
being able to eat no more breakfast. To-day, however, its effect
on him was unusual. He was delighted, it is true, and decided
instantly that he <i>was</i> driving, of course, although he had intended
going in by train and leaving the car for his mother.
The sudden change in plan necessitated hiring a car and
driver from a Tarrytown garage by telephone, writing a note
of explanation to his mother, who was still asleep, and arriving
an hour or so late at his office. This meant nothing to
him, or ordinarily would have meant nothing, compared with
the felicity of having Joan&rsquo;s company on the long drive. But
to-day, on returning from the telephone, he finished his whole
breakfast and told himself that if he drove fast perhaps he
needn&rsquo;t be much more than an hour late in town. He&rsquo;d try,
anyway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>It had been a long winter. But to-day not so much as a wispy
trace of it was left in the Wild Acres woods. As he drove
down the avenue he marveled how the last patches of snow
had melted from the hollows over night. The woods glistened
with red and purple and gold leaf-buds. To-morrow, or the
next day&mdash;or the day after that, at the latest,&mdash;it would be a
golden-green blaze through here.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nature&rsquo;s first green is gold,</p>
<p class="t0">Her hardest hue to hold&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>That was the beginning of a poem of Robert Frost&rsquo;s. Anne
had quoted or read it to Hugh sometime in the winter. He remembered
her coming to him where he sat at the piano, tentatively
searching for some theme he had heard,&mdash;keeping it soft
and just for his own ear. He had not wanted to share his music.
But Anne had wanted to share her poem. And how had he
responded? He had listened, his hands raised waiting above
the keys, to that much:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nature&rsquo;s first green is gold,</p>
<p class="t0">Her hardest hue to hold&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>and beyond that he remembered nothing. Perhaps his indifference
and self-absorption had discouraged Anne. In any
case, she hadn&rsquo;t gone on with the poem. But it wasn&rsquo;t so
much his music she had interrupted with her poetry, that far-away
afternoon in winter. It was his thoughts. And those
thoughts, his whole preoccupation, had been Joan ... Joan
... Joan.... His music was only a path, winding through
his preoccupation, a path through, not a path out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>But now, this morning, noticing the swelling purple and
red and gold of the budded trees which almost before his eyes
were rushing upon spring, the beauty Anne had failed to share
so many weeks ago pierced through to him. And it came to
him, as a matter of fact, that things in general lately had been
piercing through to him with more and more persistence. He
saw, felt, tasted, smelled the world this spring as he had not
done for many springs. Joan was in his mind more or less,
for he was still in love with her. But she no longer tinged his
perceptions of everything else as well. Anne, Glenn, his mother,
Brenda Loring, his friends at the office, spring coming,&mdash;these
held vital places of their own in his new, sharpened
attention.</p>
<p>And Ariel and Grandam? Grandam had never given way
to Joan in his thoughts, any more than she gave way to her
in actuality. As for Ariel, she did not so much enter into as
hover about the outer edges of Hugh&rsquo;s consciousness, her feet
on azure air as in her father&rsquo;s paintings. Yes. From her arrival
on the same boat with Joan, Ariel had been above and outside
but very present to Hugh&rsquo;s conscious mind.... So he
thought now, stirred to such thinking by those pointed, sharp
buds of the tree boughs.</p>
<p>Yet after all it wasn&rsquo;t these buds which had pierced through
and touched his soul. As he turned out from the spring woods
onto the Post Road, he knew that it wasn&rsquo;t the buds but something
corresponding to them. For all Ariel&rsquo;s delicate lightness,
her tenderness, it was she, her presence at Wild Acres, which
had pierced the harsh coating over his sleeping soul.</p>
<p>He jammed on his brakes and the big wheels of his car
spurted gravel on Holly&rsquo;s superbly tended driveway under
Holly&rsquo;s portico. Joan was on the steps.</p>
<p>She, too, knew that spring had come. From head to foot she
was all in fresh spring raiment. A lettuce-green hat tilted its
shade across glowing eyes. She was drawing on lemon-colored
doeskin gloves and laughing. &ldquo;I thought you were going to
drive right through and out again! What <i>were</i> you thinking
of so dourly, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>He waited while she settled in beside him, knees close together,
narrow patent-leather-slippered feet glittering by the
accelerator, her shoulder a careful inch or so from his. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
a bit dour. Quite the contrary. I was thinking of spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan opened a huge patent-leather purse, as glittering as her
feet, glanced to make sure of money, tickets, compact, kerchief,
snapped the luxurious receptacle shut, tucked it between them
on the seat, and clasped her gloved hands about her knees,
ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Spring&rsquo;s really come, hasn&rsquo;t it! And one begins to
make summer plans. I&rsquo;ve been flirting with the idea of Switzerland
all morning, and Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s colony. He wants me to
spend July there. Your little friend, Brenda, may go. And
Michael certainly will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh threw in the clutch, and they slid away down the broad
avenue between wide, freshly spaded flower-beds glowing with
hyacinths. Hugh was thinking, &ldquo;Ariel must get spring clothes
too. She was still wearing her fur coat yesterday. No wonder
she looked tired! Yesterday was almost as warm as today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan went on. &ldquo;Your engine, Hugh, is as soundless as a gull&rsquo;s
wings almost, even in first and second. Oh! It&rsquo;s too delicious!
I can think of nothing but the sea and the mountains. I think
I must fall in with Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s plan. I&rsquo;m dreadfully happy
and excited &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s spring and I&rsquo;m free to go anywhere, do
anything I please!&mdash;And you, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had given him his cue. She would sense either in his
silence or hear in words what spring, that might take her to
the other side of the world, could mean to him. Loneliness, of
course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>But to-day Hugh did not seem to be realizing what spring
should mean to him with Joan already planning to go away
because of it. He&rsquo;d missed his cue. For he was saying, &ldquo;Look
here, Joan. I want to talk to you about Ariel. It&rsquo;s rather a
strenuous existence she has with Grandam, you know. And
these New York parties on top of her work might prove a bit
too much. Last night, she turned up completely exhausted.
Anybody could see! Poor kid! So I&rsquo;ve persuaded her to break
her Saturday engagement with your crowd, or to let me
break it for her. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, Joan. I don&rsquo;t really
see how it can do her any good. If she gave up her job she might
manage that sort of thing. But I think she&rsquo;s right to prefer to
keep the job. I like her pluck. Don&rsquo;t you, really? And you
don&rsquo;t mind, do you, not having her along at whatever it is
you&rsquo;ve planned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a breath of surprised silence, Joan exclaimed, &ldquo;Of
course I don&rsquo;t mind. She isn&rsquo;t exactly one of those people who
<i>make</i> a party, is she! It&rsquo;s only that Michael&rsquo;s got the bee in his
bonnet that Gregory Clare&rsquo;s daughter needs a little polishing,&mdash;some
experience of the world. But I agree with you that
he&rsquo;s forcing the pace a bit. I was only trying to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I can imagine that. And you&rsquo;ve been sweet to Ariel these
last few days. I <i>am</i> grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joan pushed away his gratitude. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it wrong.
It&rsquo;s Michael I&rsquo;m befriending, not Ariel. After an erotic past of
thirty or forty odd years, the poor dear is ripe for the attractions
of sheer youth, as are most of his kind, not? It may be
only a flash in the pan, probably is. But I understand it&rsquo;s quite
real while it lasts. If he goes so far as to marry the little thing,
perhaps you won&rsquo;t then be so thankful I&rsquo;m helping him. For I
prophesy he&rsquo;ll murder her during the second week of the honeymoon.
He&rsquo;s as fearful of boredom as any creature I ever knew,
and by the second week Ariel will be about as stimulating as a
milk-shake. So in the end it may be accessory before the fact
you&rsquo;ll accuse me of being.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>If Joan had looked at Hugh then! But she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>After a while, &ldquo;Am I meant to take any of that seriously,
Joan?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Schwankovsky is sixty-two, you told me.
Ariel&rsquo;s twenty. I don&rsquo;t like Schwankovsky. Why should I? He
despises me and takes no pains to hide it. But he&rsquo;s being very
kind to Ariel. I haven&rsquo;t liked to see the way he paws her, naturally.
But I thought it was just his Bohemian habit. The artistic
temperament. And Ariel doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind. I trusted her
instinct: thought he must be all right, do you see, since <i>she</i>
wasn&rsquo;t revolted, no matter what I felt. But if he&rsquo;s the sort you
suggest, then she&rsquo;s never to so much as shake hands with him
again. I&rsquo;ll attend to it.... But it isn&rsquo;t so. You were&mdash;teasing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teasing! Why should I? But perhaps you misunderstood.
The gentleman&rsquo;s intentions if he has any, of which I&rsquo;m not
after all certain, are honorable. And if that&rsquo;s so, what&rsquo;s bothering
you? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be rather a wonderful marriage for such
a girl as Ariel? The murder&mdash;well, that&rsquo;ll probably turn into a
divorce. Dear old Michael wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly, you know, much
less a tender young <i>m&auml;dchen</i>. It seems to me that Ariel has all
to gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t funny. And I shall see that they don&rsquo;t
go on meeting. It&rsquo;s horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the exhibition?&rdquo; Joan asked.</p>
<p>Hugh consigned the exhibition to perdition with a breath.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that over,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and do my best with it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Joan laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a funny art patron,
Hugh! Besides, I&rsquo;m afraid that this particular exhibition needs
more money as well as more authority than you happen to be
able to bring to it. But if you are as earnest as you sound, or
even half as earnest, I might take sides with you, push Michael
into giving up the exhibition, and separate spring and winter.
How about it? Do you want my help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh, half in hope half in distrust, just glanced at his companion&rsquo;s
cameo-like profile, and surprised on it a gleam which
stirred an old and until now forgotten memory. They were a
boy and a girl just come on their skis to the top of Sparrow Hill
in the snow, up above Wild Acres. Joan was insisting on trying
a dangerously steep and tricky slide to regain her tam-o&rsquo;-shanter
which had blown over and down. Hugh dragged her
back just in time, as he thought, and holding out his arms
against her, shot past and down himself. He saw no surer way
to convince Joan of the absurdity of her intention than to break
his own neck in demonstration. As he went down he carried
with him the memory of her profile. To-day&rsquo;s very gleam was
on it then. A gleam of <i>elated malice</i>. Going down the slide he
took the gleam with him, and then with the snapping of his
ankle, for he broke it at the bottom, he forgot it ... until
this instant. And now memory&rsquo;s revival saved him. He smiled
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dull not to know when you&rsquo;re joking, Joan,&mdash;after all
these years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course, we both know that a man
doesn&rsquo;t love beautiful things and give his fortune and his time
generously to them if he&rsquo;s nothing more than a sensualist at
heart. Schwankovsky&rsquo;s devotion to Ariel is disinterested. He&rsquo;s
fascinated by everything that concerns the Clare pictures, that&rsquo;s
all. And who can wonder! They are so wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dear Hugh! If you are so sure that the pictures are wonderful
why did you keep &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; in the attic all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>He answered through his teeth. They might just as well
have been fourteen again, and back on their skis up on Sparrow
Hill. &ldquo;You know very well why I put it in the attic. It was you
put it there and not I. And you know it. But for some reason
it amuses you to make me out stupid. Why? And it isn&rsquo;t only
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve put in the attic for me, but most of my &aelig;sthetic
pleasures. You know perfectly well that I can&rsquo;t hear great music
or see a sunset without wanting to take them in my bare hands
and rush to lay them in your lap. I can&rsquo;t adore anything for its
own sake. Even God. Beauty disrupts me, gives me anguish
precisely in proportion to its loveliness, for the simple cause
that I can so seldom share it with you. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter
with me. Or it has been that way until lately. Lately, thank
God, I&rsquo;ve almost been able to care about things for their own
sakes again, as I did when I was a boy. Getting &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; out
again has helped, perhaps. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was exasperated. Weary. Now let dull misery rise again
and entomb him where the sharp-pointed buds of spring could
not pierce through. What was all their red-purple-gold to him!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nature&rsquo;s first green is gold,</p>
<p class="t0">Her hardest hue to hold ...</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>But Joan was appeased. Certainties which had quaked lately
were stable again. Hugh adored her. Just now what she usually
got only in his eyes and kisses, he had given her in words. For
once and at last he was articulate, poor darling. Complacency,
almost amounting to beatitude, re&euml;stablished itself in her
psyche. But it was a beatitude just tainted, curdled rather, with
scorn. Joan regretted the curdle. But it was inevitable. For it is
a law of the heart, she realized, that love given so completely
as Hugh&rsquo;s was given, with nothing reserved, can never have its
like in return. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; she thought a little bitterly.
&ldquo;For if I could be absolutely sure of a love like Hugh&rsquo;s, and
return it, it would be bliss. The trouble is, one can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s against
nature.&rdquo; Wistfully, some lines from an Irish poet echoed
through her mind.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Never give all the heart, for love</p>
<p class="t0">Will hardly seem worth thinking of</p>
<p class="t0">To passionate women, if it seem</p>
<p class="t0">Certain, and they never dream</p>
<p class="t0">That it fades out from kiss to kiss.</p>
</div>
<p>She pulled off her lemon-colored gloves and reached a warm
vital hand, laying each separate finger exactly on Hugh&rsquo;s fingers,
which were guiding the wheel now through Fifth Avenue
traffic. She measured their hands thus. And hers were only a
little smaller than his. For Joan&rsquo;s hands, though beautiful, with
their smooth palms and backs, and the long conical fingers,
glistening-tipped, were large and strong. The hand on Hugh&rsquo;s
shut away the hot, spring sunlight. And it seemed almost, then,
as though his whole body as by infection from the shadowed
hand was darkened slowly. Flames might any instant roar
through that dark. But his expression was unmoved except for
straightened lips. His eyes remained keen for every loophole in
the difficult traffic. Even his hand, under that shut-down vital
one on it, vibrated only with the nuances of steering.</p>
<p>Joan was absorbed like a child in the way her enameled finger
nails reflected the spring sunlight. And then she became aware
of how beautifully shaped and groomed were Hugh&rsquo;s own
almond-shaped nails. By shifting the tips of her fingers ever so
slightly she could see the moons at the base of his nails, so clear,
high and definite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have nice hands, Hugh,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Terribly
nice.&rdquo; And when he did not respond by look or word she added
with sudden generosity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;fess up, dear. I did make an idiotic
and totally moronish mistake about &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; five years ago when
you brought it to me from Bermuda. But don&rsquo;t tell on me,
please; I am ashamed. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter to you what any
one thinks of your taste. You don&rsquo;t pretend to anything, you
dear, so they can&rsquo;t show you up, do you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Hugh muttered. He meant, of
course, &ldquo;What does anything matter compared with your hand
on mine, and this darkness and its flame corroding my body,
my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Joan said, &ldquo;You can put me down at the next corner,
Hugh. I want to walk twenty blocks or so for exercise
before plunging into my silly spring shopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not stir her hand from his until the car was parked
against the curb.</p>
<p class="tb">But spring was insistent. Nothing could keep the pointed,
delicate buds from piercing their way through the harsh bark
to azure light and air and sun, and their flowering expression.
One afternoon, a few days after his drive to town with Joan,
Hugh returned to Wild Acres rather early with the idea of
persuading Ariel and his grandmother to take a drive with him,
it was such perfect weather. No one answered his knock at the
attic apartment door; so he opened it and went in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Grandam was not there on the bed nor in the long chair: only
Ariel, and she was kneeling by one of the wide-open windows,
her back to the room, looking out into the tree-tops that in the
past few days had foamed into a sea of green gold. The sunlight
slanted down this sea, at the moment of Hugh&rsquo;s arrival and
Ariel&rsquo;s watching, in a way that turned it into an unearthly
lightness of gold,&mdash;a winged, breathing <i>wind</i> of green gold.
And Ariel knelt upright at the edge of the wind-shaken loveliness
like a wand, stilled, not bent, by the high stir of beauty.</p>
<p>Hugh stopped short. He had come to Grandam&rsquo;s low table
and saw it spread with brown paper, and on the paper a heap
of wild flowers. Hepaticas, anemones, white and yellow violets,
green leaves too, and clumps of rich brown wood loam,&mdash;all
in a fragrant tangle. At the edge of the pile Ariel&rsquo;s green hat
was tossed down, with its green feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Did you collect all these?&rdquo; Hugh asked.</p>
<p>At his voice Ariel turned and stood, her body aurora&rsquo;d by the
golden stream of air and leaves behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here? Hello, Hugh! Grandam&rsquo;s driving with your
mother. It&rsquo;s such a day! I&rsquo;ve been in the woods all the afternoon,
with Persis and Nicky. Just got in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved toward him and stood by the table looking down
at the flowers. Some of the gold from beyond the window had
flowed into her hair. And when she looked up from the flowers
Hugh saw it in her eyes too,&mdash;green gold. The woods, Wild
Acres woods, beloved of Hugh, were there, shimmering, in
Ariel&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>She looked her surprise at the expression on Hugh&rsquo;s face before
her. It was so stirred, so new. Perhaps it was to break the
spell and get the familiar Hugh back again that she lifted her
hands, palm upwards,&mdash;the corners of her mouth too, in that
sharp delicate lift darted with light, that was her smile when
she danced in the woods for Persis and Nicky&mdash;and remarked,
&ldquo;Spring has come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>It had indeed. It had come rushing on a broad stream of
light and poured itself along Hugh&rsquo;s veins. The look in his face
increased rather than diminished. But Ariel had done her best,
all she knew, to relieve the intensity in Hugh&rsquo;s dark eyes. Her
knees began to tremble. She did not want Hugh to see that she
was trembling. She would be utterly ashamed if he should see.
So she sat down suddenly, on the edge of the daybed, and commenced
to part the flowers from the wood loam, and from each
other.</p>
<p>Her hands were browned by this one afternoon&rsquo;s sun and air.
They were narrow hands and small, with rather square-tipped,
very straight fingers. Hugh recalled Joan&rsquo;s hand above his own
on his steering wheel. It was white and beautiful and exquisitely
molded, a sculptor&rsquo;s dream. But these little hands&mdash;their
appeal was in their simplicity, in their graceful but
inconspicuous motions, not in their form and modeling. If he
should put his own hands down over them now they would
be quite lost, all the magic and grace of their movements
stilled away, and they would feel to him like the grubby hands
of any little girl who had been out picking wild flowers in the
woods.</p>
<p>He would put his hands down over hers. He would do that.
He would find out how it felt to capture grace like a bird under
one&rsquo;s fingers,&mdash;perhaps to destroy it in the grasp of it and so
prove it an illusion. Not real. Not actual. Not like Joan&rsquo;s beauty,
inescapable. He would prove that Ariel&rsquo;s charm for him was
something he could always control, could catch and subdue and
hide away from himself, under his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>It was only for a breath or so that he had Ariel&rsquo;s hands under
his own, crushed down in the medley of spring flowers and
damp earth. But the grace, the charm was not controlled by his
will or his hold. It escaped without a flutter of struggle. It
flowed up into the surprised lift of Ariel&rsquo;s head, the rising of
her eyelids, and spread a shimmer of green-gold light in the
quickly widening pupils of her eyes, raised to his.</p>
<p>Suddenly he discovered, and she knew that he had discovered
it, that she was trembling. What Ariel did not realize was that
Hugh was trembling too, a little.</p>
<p>He released her hands. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt the flowers,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;Sorry if I have.&rdquo; And he commenced to help her
in her sorting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put these shortest-stemmed ones in a saucer,&rdquo;
Ariel explained. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something special, don&rsquo;t you think,
about little white and yellow violets? Secret and special? They
sort of break my heart....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He should hear how her voice didn&rsquo;t tremble. She repeated
the silly words to make sure that he heard how it didn&rsquo;t: &ldquo;They
sort of break my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Well, <i>spring</i> sort of breaks <i>my</i> heart,&rdquo; Hugh responded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXI</span></h2>
<p>Joan heard voices over toward Wild Acres. They came
from the top of the wall which for half a mile or so shut
off Holly&rsquo;s well-kept grounds from the wildwood tangle of the
neighboring estate. Although she was courting solitude this
afternoon, or had intended to, Joan turned that way, out of
curiosity, and in a minute or so four backs were presented to
her. Persis, Nicky, their nurse, Alice, and Ariel Clare were all
up on the wall, their legs swinging over on the Wild Acres side,
their faces wildwood-tangleward, talking. Much overheard talk
sounds like monkey chatter, when the words are indistinguishable,
but not this of the two girls and the two children. With
such inflections, such deliberate tranquillity, the gods might
converse on Olympus. Joan drew nearer the beatitude of intercourse,
walking softly on moist spring ground, ears beginning
to catch the words.</p>
<p>The children sat between the two girls. It was Nicky speaking
now, but with a manner of speech Joan had never heard
him use before, unhurried and clear. So many imaginative and
sensitive children, when speaking to an adult, or even to their
own contemporaries, have a nervous, anxious note in their
voices, from fear of interruption or misapprehension; and
Nicky was no exception. But now it was different. Now he
spoke with unruffled but expedient precision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... I should stay away as long as I wished. Perhaps
until the next spring. And even then I would not come home
unless the pony would come with me. But he would come.
He would come for a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persis interrupted, but calmly, not startlingly. &ldquo;Where would
he sleep, Nicky? Would he have to sleep with the horses in
the stables?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Not this pony. He would just walk up the
back stairs, nights, not disturbing anybody. And mornings,
long before anybody else is up, even before the servants are
up, he will take me for long rides on his back, first through
Wild Acres, jumping all the lowest trees and streams, and
this wall, and then way beyond even Wild Acres. But Ariel
will be awake. She will lean out of her window and call,
&lsquo;Whoa!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pull him up, and we&rsquo;ll say good morning to each
other, and how did we sleep? When we go on Ariel&rsquo;ll see us
jump the sundial in the rose garden. But that will be nothing,
quite a low jump, compared to some of the trees we take in
our leaps. And during the day, Persis can sometimes go rides
on him if she likes, so long as she&rsquo;s careful that nobody sees
him, and Alice, you can have him too, often. But Ariel can
have him nights. When there&rsquo;s starlight. And she&rsquo;ll wear the
hat with the green feather. And nobody but us four&rsquo;ll know
there is a pony. And that&rsquo;s all.... Now it&rsquo;s Ariel&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When before, in Joan&rsquo;s knowledge, had Nicky ever had a
chance to say, &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all&rdquo;? She was pricked by a light remorse.
Some time she must be patient, let him say his say
through to her, his mother,&mdash;and for reward at the end,
hear his &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; like a little clear bell ringing benedictus
through a tranquil world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Ariel&rsquo;s voice was pitched lower than Nicky&rsquo;s, flat and clear.
It had little carrying quality. But Joan was so close under the
wall that she heard easily enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look for a path first. Hunt all around in Wild Acres
for the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A path! You! Are you sure, Ariel?&rdquo; Nicky asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But not a regular path. Not one we have ever seen
in there yet. A path to take me to the inside of the inside of
the woods, you see, really into fa&euml;rie. Once there, in fa&euml;rie, I
won&rsquo;t need a path, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persis leaned forward and looked up into her brother&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Do you see, Nicky,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;A path to the inside of
the inside, that&rsquo;s what Ariel means. You&rsquo;d need a path for
that. It&rsquo;s very hard to find it without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky nodded, and Ariel continued. &ldquo;The path, I think, will
begin at a place where there are little white and yellow violets,
where it&rsquo;s thick with them. The violets will show me the
path. But not with words. They haven&rsquo;t voices, and if they
had they wouldn&rsquo;t use them, not at the beginning of the path,
where everything is hush, stiller than stillest water, airy stillness.
And I couldn&rsquo;t see it with my eyes, either. They&rsquo;ll have
to tell me in another way, their own way, where it starts off,
and I&rsquo;ll have to understand without seeing or hearing, at
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Persis objected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to see or
hear to follow it. How would the violets tell you, if you can&rsquo;t
see it and they won&rsquo;t speak and it&rsquo;s <i>hush</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Alice, the nurse, spoke up, surprising Joan immensely. &ldquo;I
know, Ariel. It&rsquo;s funny about the first wildwood flowers in the
spring. They do do that to you. And it&rsquo;s the little white and
yellow violets that do it hardest. They show you something,
but something not to be seen or heard. They put a kind of
glory over you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Spring glory. I&rsquo;ll push away some of last year&rsquo;s brown
leaves, brown, brown, wet, earth-smelling.... I&rsquo;ll clear a place
for the little white and yellow violets in the air, so they&rsquo;ll
stand out on the air, clear, pure.... Then I&rsquo;ll find where the
path starts. I think it will lead to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were &ldquo;hush&rdquo; themselves, following with Ariel
where that path would lead. But Joan, taking no account of
&ldquo;hush,&rdquo; put up a hand from her side of the wall and took
hold of Persis&rsquo;s blue skirt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice story, I know, ducks, but
Miss Clare will finish it for you some other time perhaps. I
want her to come up to the house and have tea with me now.
And Alice, I don&rsquo;t approve of the children sitting around
quietly like this in the damp. It&rsquo;s not summer yet. I want them
to exercise. Get them to playing some game at once, or take
them for a walk. I thought I had made it clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persis was the first to realize the bitterness of their sudden
loss. She wailed, &ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Ariel, when will you
finish? Will you come back? When will you show us the
path? Will you dance for us in fa&euml;rie when we get there? You
do mean to take us with you, don&rsquo;t you? I thought soon you
would begin to dance. Oh, Ariel! Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come, Ariel. I&rsquo;m famished for society. Besides, I&rsquo;ve
special things I want to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice had hurried her charges down from the wall. But
the children were walking away backwards, their longing
eyes on Ariel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look for the path next time,&rdquo; she called
after them, and it sounded to their ears like a promise of the
sort that keeps itself. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll all dance in fa&euml;rie. Good-by,
Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about having tea,&rdquo; Ariel looked down at
Joan from the wall doubtfully. &ldquo;I must be back by five&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. We&rsquo;ll have it now, early. Do come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan pulled Ariel&rsquo;s arm through her own, when she jumped
down and stood beside her in Holly. Then she drew her, not
entirely unresisting, up toward the house.</p>
<p>It had been mere impulse on Joan&rsquo;s part, but now that for
the first time in their acquaintance she was to have an hour
alone with Ariel she would do what she so well had the power
of doing, throw herself, the whole concentrated weight of her
personality, into the contact,&mdash;put her own stamp upon the
coin of the moment as Ariel had put hers, Joan rather rebelliously
felt, on her contacts with Persis and Nicky. Now that
the opportunity had practically imposed itself upon her, she
was decided, once for all, to waste no more time about finding
Ariel out. She would discover her charm. Or she would discover
what passed for charm with Schwankovsky, ruthless
where personalities were concerned: with Grandam, so ultra-fastidious:
with Joan&rsquo;s own children, whom until to-day she
had thought rather typical neurotic American products. And
even perhaps with Hugh, so undiscerning, except where she,
Joan, was concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>She was not jealous of Ariel. How could she be? For Hugh,
in particular, she knew that Ariel&rsquo;s charm would never shadow
her own,&mdash;knew it all the more surely since that recent drive
to town when he had so unprecedentedly expressed his adoration
for herself in articulate sentences. But all the same she
felt it might be worth her while to explore this Ariel a little
for herself. There must be something she had missed. Besides,
she was bored. She had kept the afternoon free for a sun bath
on her roof, and a new book on the latest developments in
psychoanalysis which Doctor Steiner had urged on her. But
the sun had been unbenignantly hot, and she had dressed and
come out after less than ten minutes of it. As for the book,
which she still carried in her hand, after all there was nothing
very new in it.</p>
<p>Almost unconsciously she decided against having tea served
on the terrace, the place she would naturally choose to-day if
she were alone, but drew Ariel on toward one of the drawing-rooms.
Out of doors Ariel might escape her divining. But
against Joan&rsquo;s own background, in the green and gold drawing-room
which she had recently created with Brenda Loring&rsquo;s
assistance, with its sharp outlines and definite color combinations,
Ariel must stand out, at least in bas-relief.</p>
<p>As they traversed the wide hall Joan told herself confidently,
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, anyway, mere youth that Ariel uses. At least, she
can&rsquo;t use it in competition with me.&rdquo; For Joan had glanced
at their contrasted reflections in several long mirrors as they
passed through her hall, and in those clear reflections she
found herself more vividly young than the girl by her side.
She saw with something like relief the beautiful, clean line
of her chin and throat, the lithe Diana-ish line of thigh and
leg, the life radiating from her burnished hair, glowing brow,
and lustrous brown eyes. Ariel&rsquo;s youth, in comparison, was
lusterless. Besides, Ariel had not that added, rather terrible
attribute of the older and experienced woman, consciousness of
her power and of how to use it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Joan put Ariel into a formal, high-backed chair, facing a
window, and herself sank into the low, luxurious corner of a
sofa at right angles to the same window. A footman appeared&mdash;Joan
had rung for him as they came in&mdash;and she ordered
tea. &ldquo;And we are in a hurry, please. I&rsquo;m not at home to any
one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she gave her attention to Ariel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather a dear
to my babies.&rdquo; She was looking at Ariel with an expression of
affectionate gratitude. Joan&rsquo;s charm was a weapon which she
used as consciously and expertly as any master of fencing uses
his sword. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re utterly devoted to you. I think some day
soon I must invite you to have supper with them in the
nursery. On Nicky&rsquo;s birthday, perhaps. That&rsquo;s Sunday. It would
be such a treat to them that I imagine you&rsquo;ll be willing. You
do love children, don&rsquo;t you! Any one can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Persis and Nicky, anyway. Very much. But whether
Sunday I can get away for supper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be on the birthday, though that
would be nicest. How about to-morrow? That&rsquo;s your day off,
anyway. And you know, of course, that Hugh has broken your
engagement with Michael and me. So do make the children
ecstatic to-morrow. Nursery tea is at five-thirty. I&rsquo;ll let him
have his birthday cake then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry! I should love to. But I&rsquo;ve promised Hugh
all to-morrow. We&rsquo;re going off on a picnic in his car and won&rsquo;t
be back till after dark, I&rsquo;m afraid. Too late for the nursery
supper, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s smile rather stiffened. &ldquo;Yes? So that&rsquo;s why he cried
you off with us? Hugh was looking for a playmate for himself.
But it&rsquo;s unlike Hugh to be so uncandid. What have you
done to him, Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel could not dream, and Joan herself was astonished, at
how much she really wanted to know the true answer to this
seemingly lightly asked question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. It wasn&rsquo;t that, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Ariel answered, too ingenuously,
Joan thought, to be really ingenuous. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not thinking
of himself a bit. He&rsquo;s worried about me. Says I&rsquo;m tired.
That I ought to be out of doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet of him. And very self-sacrificing!&rdquo; Joan was flippant,
but there was something in those brilliant brown eyes&mdash;just
glimpsed in them&mdash;that rather contradicted flippancy.</p>
<p>Tea came in at the moment. When the silver tray with its
silver tea service and covered dishes was established between
them on a table brought by a second footman, and the men
had left the room, Joan sat on for some seconds, her hands
clasped around her crossed knees, looking down absently at
the food and not stirring to officiate as hostess.</p>
<p>But then she laughed abruptly, a delightful, crisp laugh, and
drew a cup toward her. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve known Hugh Weyman
many years longer than you have, you amusing girl. So you
can&rsquo;t tell me anything to surprise me about the lengths to which
his altruism will take him, given a chance. He&rsquo;s a martyr to
every one, his mother, his grandmother, his brother and sister,
and now I can very easily take your word for it, he is ready
to play the heavy father to you. He thinks he was created to
take care of people, poor dear. And if it comes to that, his
Creator seems to think so too, by the burdens He has put on
him. Cream? Lemon? Ah! When you are a middle-aged old
dud like me, Ariel, you&rsquo;ll take lemon and no sugar, thank you,
just like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She filled Ariel&rsquo;s cup one third with cream, and added the
two lumps of sugar which Ariel wanted. Then she passed
across a dish of hot English muffins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A muffin too, and dripping with butter!&rdquo; Joan murmured
enviously. &ldquo;My word, child! While I must content myself with
a dry cracker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>But Ariel, to Joan&rsquo;s secret annoyance, showed no overt surprise
that Joan&rsquo;s beautiful figure needed any such disciplining.
She ignored the opportunity for flattery and protested: &ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s
not playing father to me, not at all. He wouldn&rsquo;t think of it,
I&rsquo;m sure. We&rsquo;re very good, very wonderful friends, Mrs.
Nevin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes. Friends in a way! But that&rsquo;s only a little of the
story. I&rsquo;ll take back the &lsquo;heavy father,&rsquo; if you like, but only to
change it for &lsquo;grandfather.&rsquo; Hugh and I are pretty close, you
see. So he has a way of confiding his joys and troubles to me.
And I can tell you something about him you mayn&rsquo;t have
guessed in your rather brief acquaintance. It&rsquo;s this: this
guardian of yours is an extremely conventional person. He has
almost great-grandfatherly ideas, in fact, of how young girls
should&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t, rather&mdash;allow old men to pet them, for
instance. The fact is, Ariel, it isn&rsquo;t your physical health Hugh
is concerned for. If it were, he wouldn&rsquo;t let his grandmother
work you like a slave, as anybody can see she is doing, would
he? You do look dreadfully tired! It&rsquo;s your manners and
morals Hugh&rsquo;s bashing himself about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel said nothing. So Joan went on with it. &ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t
make Hugh see, innocent dear that he is, is that all girls your
age are like that now! Why, I suppose his own sister Anne isn&rsquo;t
so different. Petting may be as much a matter of course to her
as brushing her teeth. But naturally I don&rsquo;t drag Anne into
things when discussing your situation with Hugh. I leave him
to his illusions where his sister&rsquo;s concerned. Why not! But
with you it&rsquo;s different. You&rsquo;re not quite so vital to him&mdash;not
so near home. Still, in spite of my most earnest defense of you,
Ariel, the old dear wasn&rsquo;t persuaded. He said he was going to
arrange things so that you could have nothing to do with
Michael from now on. And that&rsquo;s the reason for the simple
life and this picnic, and if you don&rsquo;t call it grandfatherly, I
do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>This was hardly capturing Ariel&rsquo;s admiration and affection
as Joan had set out to do, nor was it a very successful method
of sounding for Ariel&rsquo;s own attractions. It was, of course, a
mere baiting of the girl,&mdash;and cheap, really beneath her, Joan
knew. But every instant since Ariel had told Joan about that
picnic, when Ariel and Hugh were to be alone together until
&ldquo;after dark, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Joan had forgotten her original direction
and purpose in this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. If by using a pin and
scratching or pricking Ariel&rsquo;s smooth, silvery flesh, she could
have drawn forth the secret of Ariel&rsquo;s attraction for Hugh, she
would happily have taken that trouble; but for any ways more
devious of accomplishing the end, she simply couldn&rsquo;t be
bothered. She would exert herself now only to wound. Yet
she thought that Ariel was escaping from even her malice,
running through her very fingers as it were,&mdash;melting away
on a background of light and air, for all that she had taken
such pains about putting four walls around her.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Ariel had not escaped from Joan at all.
She was there in that formal, straight chair, all of her there,
cold, and shut up like a stone. It was quite a minute of silence
before she asked, &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I see Michael Schwankovsky?
What do you and what does Hugh mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was looking at the frosted cakes on a Wedgwood plate
as she asked this, and Joan thought, &ldquo;She&rsquo;d take one if I&rsquo;d
pass it. She&rsquo;s thinking about cake like any greedy schoolgirl.
Why am I spending time and attention like this on a mere
chrysalis! If she&rsquo;s to grow wings some day, be a woman worth
even annoying, that day&rsquo;s far off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you see Michael? But you should, my dear.
In fact, if he&rsquo;s to go on with this exhibition of your father&rsquo;s
work, you must. It is only Hugh who thinks you shouldn&rsquo;t.
Though Hugh&rsquo;s enough to spoil the chances for the exhibition,
if he begins interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply don&rsquo;t understand, Mrs. Nevin,&mdash;what you are trying
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Trying to say!</i> She! Joan! Well, just for that Joan would
say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply this. Hugh&rsquo;s merely decided that if you&rsquo;re the sort
of girl it&rsquo;s so easy to be affectionate with, you aren&rsquo;t safe with a
person of Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s temperament. Anybody
can see that Michael can&rsquo;t keep his hands off you, and that
you would be sorry if he could. But I told Hugh that it might
come to more than petting. Suppose Michael&rsquo;s actually thinking
of marriage, Ariel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel put her cup down on the table and stood up. &ldquo;Marry
Michael Schwankovsky!&rdquo; she exclaimed&mdash;anger giving place
to shock. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s old enough to be my grandfather!&rdquo; She
looked down at Joan, and grew still again, but this time it was
not a stony stillness. It was just sudden natural relaxation. &ldquo;You
have misunderstood Hugh,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as far off
about him as you are about Michael. And they were both of
them friends of yours long before I ever knew them. So it&rsquo;s
strange you can make these mistakes.&rdquo; She said it in all simplicity
and went on, more relaxed and at peace with every
word she uttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of Michael Schwankovsky
and very grateful to him. He believes in the pictures. I&rsquo;d love
him just for that. But I love him for himself. He means more
to me than any one else living except Doctor Hazzard and
Hugh. And he&rsquo;d no more think of wanting to marry me than
Doctor Hazzard would think of it. And Doctor Hazzard&rsquo;s a
grandfather with eight grandchildren. So you see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve made just as strange a mistake about Hugh too.
Hugh&rsquo;s very fond of me. And he&rsquo;d never, never talk about me
unkindly. I know he wouldn&rsquo;t. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to hide
things, anyway. His eyes tell you what he thinks. And he&rsquo;s
never thought any hateful thoughts about me. <i>Only very good
thoughts!</i> Dear thoughts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan looked up at Ariel, after a pause. &ldquo;You do reassure me,&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;For when the time comes that I stand in a
position of second parent to you, as it were, along with Hugh,
I <i>should</i> hate to have him always fussing, and I do assure you
I&rsquo;d be on your side, not his, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A second parent to me? You mean a mother?&rdquo; Ariel
laughed, a rather interesting laugh to Joan because of the
hint of wildness in it; but she held her languid pose in the
corner of the couch, while her guest stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nevin, you&rsquo;re a little too young to be my mother,
aren&rsquo;t you, just as dear Michael is much too old to be my
lover! Hugh doesn&rsquo;t stand in the relation to me, either, that
you imply. He&rsquo;s not a guardian, or anything like that. We are
dear friends, as I told you. And now that I&rsquo;ve got my job, he
isn&rsquo;t even my host. You&rsquo;re all mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel turned toward the window, which was open, in one
swift motion of flight. But she did not fly. She was civilized.
She would say a proper good-by to her hostess and depart
with dignity by the door. Joan stood up, with slightly delayed
protests. Ariel heard her own voice asking a question
that she did not want to ask, but it was as uncontrollable as
her first motion of flight had been. &ldquo;Mrs. Nevin, are you engaged
to Hugh? Were you meaning that too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Joan restrained a smile, but <i>obviously</i> restrained it. &ldquo;No, dear
child,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But I have a refusal. If you know what
that means. It&rsquo;s a term used largely in real estate, I believe.
Must you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not hurrying you!&rdquo; Joan and Ariel turned in
surprise toward the unexpected voice. Prescott Enderly had
come in soundlessly, and was just at Ariel&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>Joan exclaimed, &ldquo;But how did you get here like this, unannounced?
I&rsquo;m not at home. Where&rsquo;s Parks? And what are
you doing away from college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word answers them all,&rdquo; Enderly replied. &ldquo;Spring!
Parks must be out somewhere watching the tulips grow. Anyway,
the door was unguarded. In the spring nothing goes according
to pattern, even your housekeeping, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan gave him her hand. He had nodded at Ariel and she
at him. Ariel was seeing him as the person who had caused
Anne all that anguish. His sea-blue eyes, crinkled now with a
forced smile, the lines in his cheeks that just escaped being
dimples and gave sympathy to his face, his eager sensitive
body, his full, sensuous but sensitive lips,&mdash;these she was
seeing with Anne&rsquo;s eyes. But he was shockingly white. The
man was simply beside himself, she felt, with some deep emotion.</p>
<p>Joan was a bit short with him. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t meaning to see
any one to-day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m even dining alone to-night. But
yes&mdash;you may stay. You&rsquo;ve come so far. I&rsquo;d rather you called
first on the telephone, however. Surprises always put me off a
little. Do they you, Ariel? Some people they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan, you are wonderful not to turn me out. But I&rsquo;d have
come, even if there was only one chance in ten thousand of
your seeing me. If I&rsquo;d called on the telephone, there wasn&rsquo;t even
that chance, I felt. You are a saint to put up with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>They seemed hardly aware when Ariel said her polite say
about the tea Joan had given her and departed. She might have
used the window after all and no one noticed. From the door
she glanced back and saw them on the sofa, Enderly bent forward,
holding both of Mrs. Nevin&rsquo;s hands in his, his eyes blue
sea fire, his face still paper white. Neither of them was speaking.</p>
<p>In her short cut home through the woods, no white and yellow
violets gave to Ariel&rsquo;s eyes or feet a path into fa&euml;rie. She
had lost fa&euml;rie for that day, lost it to quite a bewildering degree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXII</span></h2>
<p>The morning of the Gregory Clare exhibition Hugh
was waked by the clangor of birds in Wild Acres woods. The
window by Hugh&rsquo;s bed held the view like a picture frame.
Sleepily, he thought it a pity they couldn&rsquo;t hang this in the
exhibition. It was quite in the Gregory Clare manner. But
something was missing from it. The painter&rsquo;s daughter. Where
would he, Hugh, put her, if he were the painter? There at
the right, where the sunlight was silvery in the tops of the
giant beech, her head not quite level with the highest branch,
standing still on the breathless, silvery-green-gold air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Hugh was to meet his mother in town for lunch and be with
her at the New Texas Galleries in time for the opening of the
doors. Joan had offered to drive Ariel in directly after lunch,
and get her there in good time for the opening also. That was
kind of Joan. Remembering and appreciating this kindness of
Joan&rsquo;s was Hugh&rsquo;s first thought of her this morning. He noticed,
just in passing, this surprising fact. When before had he
ever been awake for any length of time without thinking of
Joan! And now she had come only in connection with Ariel
and the exhibition. Certainly to sail coolly into town in Joan&rsquo;s
open roadster would be far better for Ariel than traveling in
alone on the stuffy local. It promised, already, to be a very
warm day. Hugh regretted, however, that Grandam had not
taken his suggestion of sending Ariel in for lunch with his
mother and himself. She might be devoted to Ariel, but working
her to death was a strange way of showing it. Ariel had
been very quiet as to what she felt about this great day herself;
but Hugh knew it to be one of the most exciting and exhilarating
days of her life.</p>
<p>He lay down again. It was very early, just past dawn. He
half imagined, half dreamed himself waiting for Ariel in the
little anteroom of the galleries, her arrival, pale with excitement,
and his rising to steady her and share in her feelings of
elation and joy. Taking her arm through his and holding her
hand steadily and firmly under his elbow against his side,
they mixed with the crowd which was genuflecting and chattering
before her father&rsquo;s genius.</p>
<p>No one would guess that the inconspicuous girl on the arm
of the inconspicuous, rather typical New York business man
was the dancer of the pictures. Least of all would any one, now
or ever, know that Hugh had given to the painter his first
taste of practical appreciation in buying &ldquo;Noon&rdquo; for one thousand
dollars. It would be delightful, masquerading with Ariel
like this, sharing alone in all that crowd their secrets. For
some reason his mother, Schwankovsky, Charlie Frye, even
Joan herself, did not enter into this early morning daydream.
But Hugh did not miss them. In fact, they would have spoiled
the point, the reason of its creation, which was his isolation
with Ariel in her first great happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>He went up to the attic as soon as he had had his breakfast.
Grandam and Ariel had been awake and dressed since the
crack of dawn. Grandam was as stirred as Ariel about the
significance of the day, and it occurred to Hugh that that was
why she had wanted to keep Ariel with her until the last possible
minute. She, too, had her daydream of sharing happiness
with the dear girl. She was lying in her long chair at the edge
of the almost too warm sunshine which fell through the open
tall window. Ariel was just finishing turning the night bed into
a daybed. She placed the last silver pillow as Hugh came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noon&rdquo; was gone from the mantel, but the whole room had
taken on its atmosphere. It seemed that in vanishing it had
left its very glamour and light behind. And it had left the
dancer. She was there with a shallow dish of hepaticas in her
hand, a dish that might have been a wide sea shell, reaching
up to place it on the mantel. In an ivory silk blouse, opened at
the throat, and a clinging green skirt, her hair a wave of light
on her neck&mdash;and the identical light of the spring morning
in her eyes and at the corners of her uptilted lips, she was the
dancer glorified.</p>
<p>Hugh had a swift sense as he entered that Ariel, Grandam
and the room were all aswim in the clear light that was Gregory
Clare&rsquo;s imagination: that he was seeing them as they existed
only in Gregory Clare&rsquo;s heart, not in his, Hugh Weyman&rsquo;s,
dull life. For the moment he knew that his friend was
not dead, that Ariel was still his care, and still moved through
his imagination, the dancer. Almost jealously Hugh came
forward, tried to enter and be where Ariel was, in that realm
of imagination and light.</p>
<p>And he did not entirely fail. For the few minutes he stayed
in Grandam&rsquo;s apartment the world was fresh and life was
winged.</p>
<p class="tb">There was a crush in the anteroom of the exhibition when
Hugh and his mother arrived. Schwankovsky had promised
them this would be so, and Hugh&rsquo;s daydream had previsioned
it. Although they had made a point of being ten minutes
early, the room was already full of curious and eager men
and women, and the three elevators in the hall of the building
were steadily discharging more groups of crowding humanity
to add to the discomfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>There was no question of Hugh finding a chair for his
mother while they waited that ten minutes. They were lucky,
they felt, in having and retaining standing room. As the day
had turned out to be an unseasonably hot day, far more like
August at its hottest than mid-May, the room was almost unbearably
close.</p>
<p>Very soon Mrs. Weyman murmured, &ldquo;Really, Hugh, I
shan&rsquo;t be able to stay. I&rsquo;d rather go out and return to-morrow
after the first rush. After all, what is the advantage in being
among the first in the stampede for this show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do stick it if you can, darling,&rdquo; Hugh urged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find
you some ice-water. Will that help?&rdquo; He himself was only
stimulated to a kind of elation by the heat and the pressing
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will help. But you&rsquo;re the only person I know,
Hugh, who would so confidently promise ice-water in these
circumstances. And the nice part of it is that I know you&rsquo;ll
manage it somehow. You&rsquo;re awfully satisfactory, dear boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned down at her his appreciation of her appreciation,
patted her arm, and vanished like a genie. When he returned
through the envious crowd, steadying a paper cup
filled to the brim with ice-water, he found that Schwankovsky,
against all the laws of physics, had made a place for his great
bulk in the room somehow, and was towering above Mrs.
Weyman, talking down at the top of her smart spring hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Warm?&rdquo; he was booming. &ldquo;Why, I hadn&rsquo;t thought so.
Hadn&rsquo;t noticed. Those pictures in there are more on my mind
than the weather. They&rsquo;re going to take you by storm, I promise.
You never saw sunlight in paint before, on canvas. It&rsquo;s
epoch-making. You&rsquo;ll see. It almost blinds you, this Clare sunlight
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman shuddered prettily, and gratefully took the
drink from Hugh&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t he paint any shade?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;If not, I absolutely shall not risk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! You wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for the world. But where&rsquo;s my
Ariel? I thought she was with you, Weyman. She must be
here when the doors are opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was annoyed. He felt it very important for Ariel&rsquo;s
peace of mind and her enjoyment of the victory&mdash;if the exhibition
was to prove a victory&mdash;that she should be unrecognized,
and he expected Schwankovsky to think of this and be
a little careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan&rsquo;s driving Ariel in. They&rsquo;ll be here any minute,&rdquo; he
replied in as low a voice as he could use and still be heard.</p>
<p>But the minute hand on the face of Schwankovsky&rsquo;s absurd
little platinum wristwatch moved on under his anxious gaze,
and proved Hugh wrong. Schwankovsky waited five minutes
beyond the announced time of the opening for Joan and Ariel
to make their appearance before, with a disappointed grunt,
he gave the sign to Charlie Frye to slide back the big doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for them,&rdquo; Hugh told his mother. &ldquo;You go on
in, though. It&rsquo;ll be cooler there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very much cooler. The gallery where the Clare pictures
were hung was a huge room covering nearly half a block,
and the crowds which had choked the anteroom, Hugh could
observe through the great open doors, were mere driblets of
humanity almost lost in the expanse of floor space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>He pushed a chair to an open window, where he would
find air to breathe if there was any, and composed himself,
outwardly, to wait. People continued to arrive by the elevators,
and even some undaunted and impatient ones by the stairs.
They hesitated in the anteroom to secure their catalogues from
Charlie Frye, who was officiating at the desk there, and passed
quickly on into the gallery, where a babble, as the minutes
passed, was rising gradually higher and higher, with Schwankovsky&rsquo;s
big voice forever cresting it.</p>
<p>Hugh spent his time between watching the door for the
appearance of the girls and studying the catalogue which
Charlie Frye had, unsolicited, thrust into his hands. It was a
good-looking catalogue, engraved on creamy, thick paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shell&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Tree in the Sun&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Reef&rdquo; ...
&ldquo;Under the Rock.&rdquo; ...</p>
<p>Gradually he worked down the list of two hundred odd
titles. And although he knew that the dancer appeared in them
all, in no title was she mentioned. He was vastly relieved by
this fact. But then his eye caught something it had missed.
&ldquo;212. Sketch for the Dancer.&rdquo; He remembered Schwankovsky&rsquo;s
mention of this sketch and he was chilled. Schwankovsky
had said that life without it would be unthinkable, or
something as exaggerated.</p>
<p>A finger of shadow fell on &ldquo;212. Sketch for the Dancer.&rdquo;
Hugh sprang to his feet, for he was aware of Joan, and had
a sense that she had been standing beside him for some appreciable
seconds before she made the stir that flung the
shadow. She gave him her hand. He took it warmly, but instantly
looked beyond her for Ariel. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>If his question had been a slap in Joan&rsquo;s face a more scarlet
stain would not have whipped her cheeks. She looked at
Hugh with astonishment too profound to hide. But he missed
it, still looking for Ariel. Others, however, were not so unobservant.
Art-lovers passing through the anteroom into the
gallery turned their heads, and even paused to look again at
the tall, very beautiful woman who appeared so gloriously
angry. Meanwhile, she controlled her voice, if not her blazing
eyes, and explained about Ariel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t coming. Your grandmother was taken ill, one of
her attacks. In the middle of the morning. The servants got
Doctor Bradshaw at once, and he brought a nurse. Ariel, in
the excitement, I suppose, forgot to call me and explain. So
when I went for her she merely came downstairs and told me
about it. I offered to stay in her place and let Amos drive her
in. But she wouldn&rsquo;t listen. She wouldn&rsquo;t stay long enough
even to give me the essential details to bring to you. So I insisted
on seeing Doctor Bradshaw. He assured me that the
danger was quite past, for this time. He said, too, that Ariel
was not needed now, and could come into the exhibition of
her father&rsquo;s paintings as well as not. I gathered that the poor
child in her anxiety had been and was still being a trifle officious
and that both doctor and nurse would be glad to have
her out of it. But she was stronger than any of us.&mdash;Now
I&rsquo;m killed, sir, in all this heat, and without a glass of water or
anything. Your messenger may fall dead at any moment. Smiling
though, in the heroic manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh did not rally to her humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;ll let me take your car, won&rsquo;t you, and go right
out there? Schwankovsky or somebody will send you home.
Where did you leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No. Sorry. But you know I never let
any one, even you, drive my car. You haven&rsquo;t been into the
gallery yet? You must come in with me for a few minutes,
and then I&rsquo;ll drive you out myself, if you insist. I assure you
Doctor Bradshaw&rsquo;s not a bit worried, and for this time the
danger to your grandmother is past. But seriously, first I must
cool my throat. Is there water anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Schwankovsky, catching sight of them, barged
down into their path, insisting that they produce his Ariel.
When he learned that she was not coming at all to-day, he appeared
to be desolated. He took his beard in his hands and declared
it was too bitter. But the next instant he was dragging
Joan and Hugh forward to point out for them with exuberant
joy the canvases that pleased him most.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;That ought to be called, &lsquo;The
Dancer.&rsquo; But we left Clare&rsquo;s own titles, of course. This is the
painting for which he made the sketch, &lsquo;The Dancer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was one of the newer pictures, since Hugh&rsquo;s visit to Bermuda.
And it must, in fact, be comparatively recent, for there
was Ariel as she was now. It might be a portrait of her, for
here, as in not one of the other paintings, she was the theme.
The foreground was a line of tide on a beach of silver sand.
The misty, dewy light said early morning. The dancer had
taken a shell from the fingers of the incoming tide, and she
was straightening from having reached for it. She held it
before her with extended arms, her fingers curling its outward
edges, and her expression of face and body was all of delight
and gratitude. The moist wind bent her hair back from brow
and neck. It bent her violet tunic back against knees and
breasts. And for the first time, here in a painting, Hugh was
consciously aware, with an odd pang of recognition, of what
he had seen only half-consciously before,&mdash;the beautiful and
na&iuml;ve shape of her eyelids.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s not dancing!&rdquo; He heard Joan&rsquo;s voice as if from
a great way off, although in reality she was close by his side.
&ldquo;Why, Michael, do you want to call it &lsquo;The Dancer&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but my friend! Isn&rsquo;t it plain? She has just found this
shell in the foam, brought to her by the tide. She is the soul of
this fragile, drifting shell. Or the shell is her soul. God knows
which is which, but one is true. All that one does know is
that those two hands with those so deliciously curling fingers
will lift the iridescent thing higher and higher, as her figure
comes more and more erect. Finally, with it held as high as
her hands can reach above her head, she will dance, looking
up at it. Slowly. A religious dance of gratitude. It is my Ariel.
And she dances gratitude. Gratitude to God Himself for the
gift of her soul and for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan laughed. &ldquo;Oh, Michael! You aren&rsquo;t talking art. That&rsquo;s
mystical mush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; Schwankovsky agreed with good humor. &ldquo;Probably,
in fact. But my Ariel, even in pictures, has a way of
turning me into a mystical mush. She is so sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible! Please spare my sensibilities, and the sensibilities
of the two or three hundred people who are listening to you,&rdquo;
Joan murmured nervously, for at times being about with
Michael Schwankovsky publicly was embarrassing,&mdash;yes,
even when as now he was the sole patron of an exhibition, and
every one knew he was the famous Michael Schwankovsky.</p>
<p>Hugh said in a low but emphatic voice, &ldquo;Schwankovsky! I
want to buy this picture. It&rsquo;s here in the catalogue as &lsquo;The
Shell.&rsquo; Do I arrange it with you or Frye?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>But Schwankovsky hummed, deep in his throat. &ldquo;Um ...
Ah ... Um ... This one, Weyman, we&rsquo;ve given a rather
high figure. I did that, meaning to get it myself. However,
when you take it up with Frye&mdash;he&rsquo;s the business manager&mdash;say
I waive my claim, if, hearing the price, you still want it.
No sales are being made until the end of the exhibition, but
people are speaking ahead, of course. The sketch for this
painting, let me tell you, nobody could get for love or money.
It&rsquo;s mine. It&rsquo;s really finer than the painting. There&rsquo;s an exquisiteness,
almost supernatural, that is lost in the paint. And
the foot and leg, the turn of that bared shoulder&mdash;it&rsquo;s spiritually
ravishing. But if you can afford to own &lsquo;The Shell,&rsquo;
Weyman, you needn&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s the pick of all the paintings&mdash;except
for &lsquo;Noon.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off in disgust, suddenly remembering &ldquo;Noon&rsquo;s&rdquo;
history, and Hugh&rsquo;s connection with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Frye lets &lsquo;The Shell&rsquo; go to you, he&rsquo;d better see that a
contract goes with it, stating explicitly that you&rsquo;ll not hang it
in your attic or your cellar. Come to think of it, Weyman,
you&rsquo;re probably an art sadist!&rdquo; He turned on Joan. &ldquo;Would
that be possible? You know all about morbid psychology. Do
some men like to torment artists as others like to torment
women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan shrugged this away. And Hugh was too genuinely
moved by the painting before him, and by his underlying
anxiety for his grandmother, to speculate which Schwankovsky
thought himself, humorous or insulting. Joan took
Hugh&rsquo;s arm and said impatiently, but her impatience was directed
toward Michael Schwankovsky, &ldquo;Hugh! It&rsquo;s getting
dreadfully close! Let&rsquo;s look at the &lsquo;Studio&rsquo; Michael&rsquo;s giving me,
and dash off. How will your mother get home? We must find
her and tell her about your grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will come back to-morrow and all the days, I trust,&rdquo;
Schwankovsky commanded them both. &ldquo;And please take my
devoted respects to Mrs. Weyman. The first minute she will
see me I shall beg the privilege. But she knows this. She&rsquo;s
agreed to send me word when next I may have that felicity.
And give my Ariel my fondest love, fondest kisses, and describe
for her the crowds and the enthusiasm. Our success is
already apparent. Not? But you look tired, Joan, my girl! It
is the heat. Insist on driving, Weyman. She has no business to
be your chauffeur, looking like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were down on the Avenue, walking toward the
spot where Joan, by bribing a policeman pretty heavily, had
been able to park only half a block from the galleries, Hugh
urged, &ldquo;Do let me drive, Joan. Schwankovsky&rsquo;s right. The
heat has got you. I won&rsquo;t strip the gears, or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joan autocratically rejected the idea. &ldquo;It will be cooler
the minute we are out of this ghastly city,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have had Amos put down the top if I&rsquo;d realized what a blazing
day it is. But we won&rsquo;t even stop to get it up now. Only I
don&rsquo;t want to worry you, Hugh. You will tell me if I go too
fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh, however, very justly and at all times admired Joan&rsquo;s
driving, and to-day was no exception. It occurred to him, as
they won out of traffic at last to the open road, where speed
was not only possible but safe, that she would like to frighten
him by her use of the accelerator,&mdash;that she wanted him to
think her unduly reckless. But he knew, instinctively, that she
would not for an instant endanger her beautiful body and
rich life. So her passenger was safe. This was not a matter of
skiing, where their interests were separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; she asked, snatching a glance at
his profile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>He could scarcely tell her the truth, that he was seeing her,
and for the first time, as a woman who would never under
any circumstances be capable of living dangerously: that she
might encourage it in others, but never if it involved herself.
Besides, he imagined that he was still in love with her, and so
he let the sudden unflattering perception slip from the foreground
of his mind even as she asked her question. He said,
what in truth had been very much in his heart all the time,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame Ariel missed the opening. Did she seem dreadfully
disappointed? Or was she too upset by Grandam&rsquo;s attack
to realize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she realized. Imagination isn&rsquo;t exactly Ariel&rsquo;s
long suit, is it? And of course, she was upset about your
grandmother. Pain isn&rsquo;t ever pretty&mdash;&rsquo;specially to the young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father died that way. Did you know? So it would be
all the worse. Poor girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan gripped the wheel. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to make time,&rdquo; she
warned. &ldquo;Watch out for motor police, please. Your Ariel&rsquo;s
not a &lsquo;poor girl&rsquo; at all. A supremely lucky one. In one day,
without any merit or effort of her own, she&rsquo;s become financially
independent and perhaps even famous too. The next
question, though, is: will the dear public ever grasp the fact
that Gregory Clare idealized his model beyond conception?
Or will they think her beautiful and talented, hypnotized by
the suggestions of the press and Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s ravings?
What will they do to her? Pay her a fabulous fortune
for showing herself to them in the talkies, or go by the thousands
to see her walk around in front of velvet curtains, waving
her arms above her head and kneeling now and then&mdash;an
&aelig;sthetic dancer? What&rsquo;s your guess, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Hugh was some time before even trying to answer the cool
and slightly weary voice of his interlocutor. When he did
speak, finally, he too sounded slightly weary. &ldquo;Personally, I
don&rsquo;t see why the public should bother about Ariel at all. But
you and Brenda Loring seem to take it for granted that they
will, so I&rsquo;m wrong probably. It&rsquo;s rather up to us, isn&rsquo;t it, to
protect her from cheap publicity. It&rsquo;s in Schwankovsky&rsquo;s
power, I&rsquo;m sure. Will you speak to him, Joan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan shook her head. &ldquo;Schwankovsky happens to be hypnotized
by the ways Gregory Clare found of putting light on
canvas. But some other just as good critics are going to be
even more hypnotized by how a great artist has been able to
take one single model and by changing her postures make of
her a whole symphony of the dance, a kaleidoscopic vision of
the possibilities of beauty in movement of the feminine form....
If only Ariel had the beauty that Clare has imagined and
created there! But she simply hasn&rsquo;t any quality which will
justify the free publicity she&rsquo;ll be getting from all this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think she <i>will</i> need protection. But <i>ours</i>, Hugh, not
Schwankovsky&rsquo;s. Whatever Michael&rsquo;s talents are, protecting&rsquo;s
not one of them. I should think we&rsquo;d be agreed on that, you
and I. No, it&rsquo;s up to us, if you think she&rsquo;s worth the bother.
And you do, I know. You&rsquo;ve been a darling from the very
first about this girl. You are the protector supreme, my dear.
It&rsquo;s quite your character! Would you be pleased if I helped
a little, took her off your hands? I might even invite her to
Switzerland with me next month. Would that help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh knew at once that it would help, immensely. What
better could happen to Ariel this summer than that a woman
like Joan should take her in hand, travel with her? And wasn&rsquo;t
it very wonderful of Joan? Mightn&rsquo;t Hugh take hope and
heart from the fact that Joan was at last identifying her interests
with his own in this sudden and generous way?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>But oddly enough, he took neither hope nor heart. His heart,
in fact, instead of responding joyously, had set up a lonely,
almost sullen thud. He did not want Ariel to go to Switzerland,
next month,&mdash;even with Joan.</p>
<p>As he was not responding to her wildly generous suggestion,
Joan after a minute of waiting began talking fast, for her, and
nervously. &ldquo;Did you notice that in all these pictures Clare
takes great care to paint Ariel turned away&mdash;or if her face is
there, he blurs it with light, or throws a shadow across it, or
bends it down. It seems that he wasn&rsquo;t so oblivious of the
limitations of his model, then, doesn&rsquo;t it? Her face, at least,
never touched his imagination. There&rsquo;s a whole theme for a
tragic novel in that! The tragedy of an artist,&mdash;<i>His muse, full
face, is not beautiful</i>. Rather subtle, that! Too subtle for you,
Hugh, I&rsquo;m afraid. But it quite thrills me. Some day I may
write it. It would be big, profound.... Do you remember,
Hugh, how you said that Ariel made no impression on you in
Bermuda? How shadowy she was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? Yes, I know I did. Well, she was like some figure
in a dream, so absolutely <i>quiet</i>. But surely you are wrong
about Clare. He was more aware than a stupid Philistine like
me could ever be. He got it <i>all</i>. Have you forgotten &lsquo;The
Shell&rsquo;? That is his portrait of Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think her beautiful there?&rdquo; Joan asked, genuinely
surprised. &ldquo;Those narrow, greenish eyes! The thin, sharp
lips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. No. She isn&rsquo;t beautiful by any special standards.
But did you notice her eyelids in that painting? They are
astonishingly beautiful, by <i>any</i> standards.... Their pure
corners ... petals ... And her hair....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! You aren&rsquo;t convinced! You do think her as beautiful
every bit as Michael does? Is it seeing her in all those
pictures this afternoon that&rsquo;s made you? You&rsquo;ve said all
along&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh laughed constrainedly. &ldquo;This is nonsense. We&rsquo;re babbling
along like two schoolgirls about another girl! But I do
admit and know that of course Ariel Clare is not a beautiful
or even a pretty girl.... All the same, Beauty itself <i>has</i> her,
possesses her. Now you, Joan, dear, have Beauty. You possess
It. Do you see the distinction? It&rsquo;s a real one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Indeed I don&rsquo;t. Hugh, you are maddening. Are you
paying me a compliment in this new and inimitably mystical
way of talking, or are you laughing at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh put his arm along the seat at Joan&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
most beautiful girl this poor mortal has ever seen or dreamed
of, Joan my dear. You know that, and God help me. Let&rsquo;s
forget Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget Ariel. Let&rsquo;s forget Ariel. Let&rsquo;s forget Ariel.&rdquo;
The words were merely an echo of a thin high cry that had
arisen days ago in his heart.</p>
<p>Imperceptibly but very actually Joan&rsquo;s strong white hand
relaxed on the glossy wheel. Hugh thought, &ldquo;Her driving is
superb. But I do hope she keeps up the speed and doesn&rsquo;t slow
down again. If she does keep it up we&rsquo;ll be there soon,
soon....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Joan, though happily unconscious that she was doing
so, gratified his unspoken desire. She drove where it was absolutely
safe to do so at an almost terrific speed, and she did not
speak again until she let Hugh out at his door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXIII</span></h2>
<p>In a minute Hugh was standing in the hot attic hallway,
among the bowls and jars of flowers which had been swept
with the rest of Grandam&rsquo;s personality out of her room. Under
his feet, where his haste had almost broken it, was the wide,
shell-like dish of hepaticas he had watched Ariel put up on the
mantel long, long ago, that morning.</p>
<p>He opened the door of the attic apartment cautiously, without
knocking. As twice before when Grandam had had these
heart attacks, her personality had fled the room and left it
amazingly bare, even barren. The daybed was there by the
long open window, white and stark, no violet and silver
cushions left to its adornment,&mdash;and on it, straight between
white sheets, propped high on white pillows, Grandam lay unstirring.
Ariel sat in a chair on the far side of the bed, facing
the door, hands folded in her lap. There was something in her
posture and utter stillness that said she had been thus immobile
a long while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Hugh came as near to the daybed as he dared. Even then
Ariel did not look up. She was intent on Grandam&rsquo;s sleeping
face. He noticed how tiny gold freckles stood out on her cheeks
and nose, freckles that the silvery tone of her skin generally
concealed but which were shown up now by pallor. Her hair,
as in &ldquo;The Shell,&rdquo; was bent back from her temples,&mdash;only now
by the air of Death, not of the sea, Hugh thought. And to him,
still under the power and beauty of &ldquo;The Shell,&rdquo; she seemed
a figure watching at the edge of the tide of death, wondering
how high it would come, how close to her watching eyes, her
folded hands.</p>
<p>Grandam was sleeping with apparent comfort and tranquillity,
her face, airily and delicately mysterious, a face that
in its elusive quality had somehow escaped all the marks of
the usual human experiences&mdash;old age, fear, and now even
Death.</p>
<p>Hugh ever since he was grown up, and much more since
his father&rsquo;s death, had realized Grandam&rsquo;s uniqueness. Her
only son, Hugh&rsquo;s father, had been her last great love left to
her, but when he went Grandam had remained as now, elusive
of suffering. It was when his father died, or soon after,
that Grandam gave herself away to Hugh in confidences, and
ever since the already close bond of sympathy between them
had been closer.</p>
<p>She had reminded Hugh that she had married a man twenty
years older than herself. His friends had become her friends;
he had a genius for friendship and the men and women he
knew intimately and had drawn to himself were people of rich
lives, spiritually and intellectually. Among them were poets and
painters, saints and humanitarians. Their values were spiritual.
Grandam married when she was seventeen. Hugh&rsquo;s father was
born when she was twenty; and that same year her husband
died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>But in those three short years of a perfect marriage Grandam
had made herself as accepted and loved by her husband&rsquo;s
circle of rare friends as he was himself.... &ldquo;My love identified
me with him. That is the only way I can explain such a
miracle,&rdquo; she told Hugh, that one brief hour some time in the
course of their coming together in grief for his father&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>But she never felt worthy of the remarkable friendships.
She knew, none better, that she must fly, race, to keep up with
her husband&rsquo;s friends and himself in their flight through time
and in Eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who has helped me most in this flight, this race,
is the possessor of those hands.&rdquo; She indicated the drawing
of the hands from which Hugh had never known her to be
separated, whether at home or traveling. Wherever Grandam
was, there always in her bedroom hung the ebony-framed
drawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He taught me short cuts. After Hugh died (her husband
Hugh, she meant) I would have lost the race if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for &lsquo;The Saint.&rsquo; For if Hugh was so far ahead of me in Time
here, in Eternity he would be lost&mdash;like a star shot into space.
But &lsquo;The Saint&rsquo; made me have faith that there are ways of
keeping in touch even with shooting stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &lsquo;The Saint&rsquo; himself and all my husband&rsquo;s loves have
left Time, one after another,&mdash;and me here in Time. Even
my son has left me behind here. But Time and Eternity are
really one in a mysterious way, as &lsquo;The Saint&rsquo; taught me, and
so I am racing still, a girl at the tail of the race, but in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandam had ended these confidences concerning her inner
life on a humorous word. &ldquo;The whole point of this story,
Hugh, is that I am <i>God&rsquo;s accident</i>. He let me into Time
twenty years too late. So I&rsquo;ve just had to leave time out of my
practical life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>And Hugh knew she had succeeded. Grandam had eluded
time. That constituted the mystery of her elusiveness. And
looking down at her now, there was nothing of the pity of
vigorous youth in his glance. Whether she died to-night or
next month didn&rsquo;t matter. Her death would hardly be so much
as a stumble in the race she was running with that clan of
noble souls!</p>
<p>Ariel had become aware of Hugh&rsquo;s presence. She came beside
him, took his coat sleeve between a thumb and forefinger,
and drew him away from the bed toward the piano.
There, as far from the daybed as they could get, she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was like Father. This happened to him several times,
before the last one. She was too ill to take the medicine. So
I used the hypodermic, as I had done with Father, and as
Doctor Bradshaw had said I should with Grandam. Rose got
him on the telephone. But it was almost over when he got
here. He said that Rose and I and Nora had done everything
we could have done to help her. He brought Miss Freer, the
nurse, with him. She&rsquo;s down in the kitchen now. She&rsquo;s very nice
and Grandam likes her ... Grandam was very brave....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel looked down, away from Hugh&rsquo;s intent eyes, and her
dropped eyelids, delicately etched, petal-shaped, took his breath
with their loveliness as they had in &ldquo;The Shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>... &ldquo;She threw her scarf over her face, Hugh, so that I
shouldn&rsquo;t see the agony of the pain.... Oh, Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted eyes, clear of tears, but pitiful. And Hugh had
been thinking of petal eyelids and eerie gold freckles, when
it was death and agony that were here, close by. His beloved
Grandam&rsquo;s death and agony. It was suddenly Hugh who had
tears. His throat ached with them, and the light went black
with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Instinctively, he felt for and found Ariel&rsquo;s wrist and held
it hard. When he could see again, Ariel was still there by his
side, but looking away toward the daybed, a tender patience
on her face, keeping watch over Grandam&rsquo;s peace. Then Hugh
remembered the exhibition. Ariel had not asked or looked a
word about it. And such a little time ago it had meant so
much to her! It was really to have been Ariel&rsquo;s and her dead
father&rsquo;s great hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a woman, this girl,&rdquo; Hugh knew with his whole soul
then. &ldquo;Life falls into its just proportions before the eyes of
her womanhood. She has forgotten herself. She has even forgotten
her father in sharing Grandam&rsquo;s suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was overwhelmingly rejoiced. He felt that neither life
nor death could ever sadden him again, because one woman
was so good, so sweet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXIV</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your line has been busy for the past hour! Big business?&rdquo;
It was Joan&rsquo;s voice, coming to Hugh through his office
telephone toward noon the following morning.</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;Reporters mostly. The papers are on to the
exhibition, and all you prophesied seems to be coming true
about the part they&rsquo;re giving Ariel in their stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. They&rsquo;ve been hectoring us here too. I&rsquo;m at
the gallery with Michael and Charlie. You can thank me,
Hugh, for keeping Michael from giving them the story about
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo; in the attic. He&rsquo;s absolutely promised now. And
Charlie has promised. It&rsquo;s safe. And your &lsquo;Shell&rsquo; is safe too.
Michael&rsquo;s going to let you have it. I&rsquo;ve bought you one myself,
Hugh. I&rsquo;d have wanted you to choose it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t
wait. Every last painting, even the sketches, have been bid
for. The Metropolitan is going to get the lion&rsquo;s share. A fortune
seems to have been donated by some dark angel. It will
probably come out who, though. So far, Michael claims it&rsquo;s
not he. &lsquo;Sun and Wind&rsquo;s&rsquo; the painting I&rsquo;ve bought for you,
Hugh. For your birthday! It&rsquo;s the only canvas without the
Dancer. If for nothing else that makes it a prize, of course.
Priceless some day. Have the reporters invaded Wild Acres
yet? They know, of course, that Ariel is there. And when <i>is</i>
she coming in? Michael wants to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful of you to remember my birthday, Joan. I don&rsquo;t
remember &lsquo;Sun and Wind.&rsquo; But I&rsquo;m grateful. You shall hang
it for me at Wild Acres. But the attic&rsquo;s barred....&rdquo; They both
laughed.... &ldquo;Ariel&rsquo;s not coming in till to-morrow afternoon.
Grandam clings to her. She&rsquo;s so very weak. I wouldn&rsquo;t be here
myself, but there was something that had to be attended to
at the office.... To-morrow Glenn and Anne are getting
away from college to see Grandam, and they&rsquo;ll take in the exhibition.
If Grandam&rsquo;s better, Ariel and I&rsquo;ll meet &rsquo;em at the
Grand Central, the noon train, and come right along to the
gallery before going out to Wild Acres. Tell Schwankovsky
that, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till to-morrow! Well, he will be disappointed. Ariel
might think of him a little, after all he&rsquo;s done for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does. Of course, Joan. Last night she wrote him a letter,
a very dear one, I imagine. I put a special on it and posted
it in the Grand Central this morning. He&rsquo;ll have it when he
goes home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Well, that may appease him. Where are you lunching,
Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you if you&rsquo;ll let me, and why don&rsquo;t I come right up
and get you now?&rdquo; But he had little hope of Joan&rsquo;s acceptance,
for it was likely that she had already arranged to lunch with
Schwankovsky. &ldquo;Only alone. Please don&rsquo;t take me up if there&rsquo;s
to be any one else along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>The pause which followed this at the other end of the wire
protracted itself. Then in a lowered voice, as though not
wanting any one at her end of the wire to hear, Joan replied,
&ldquo;Of course we had made plans. But I&rsquo;d rather be with you,
Hugh. I&rsquo;ll have to think of a way out.... Ah! Well, come
for me here then, but not before one o&rsquo;clock. I know a cool
place, small,&mdash;a garden in 33rd Street. We won&rsquo;t be bothered
by any of our own crowd there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sounded like Hugh&rsquo;s good fortune. It sounded like that
to him, to his ears, to his brain. But deeper than that&mdash;? There
were no answering vibrations deeper. Yet his reply
went over the wire in as resonant a voice as though all his
heart were behind it, so strong is habit, &ldquo;Bless you. You&rsquo;re
an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Hugh, Ariel, Glenn and Anne swung up the Avenue
through May sunshine, headed for the New Texas Galleries.
As they neared Fifty-ninth Street, Glenn strode ahead, and by
the time the others had come up had bought a bunch of
arbutus from a vender on the corner there. He handed them
to Ariel. She was enchanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do with them?&rdquo; Hugh asked.
To carry them in her hand for the next few hours would be
wasted effort, for they would be very dead, indeed, by the
time the afternoon was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, cherish them, of course. I love them,&rdquo; Ariel responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; She held them to her nose again,
and her expression seemed one of assurance that anything
that thrilled and delighted her as these pink-and-white-tight
Heaven-smelling flowers did would live forever. Looking
down at her, Hugh believed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>They made rather an arresting group even in the stream of
arresting people which throngs the Avenue on spring afternoons:
Hugh, with his high-held, hawklike, dark head, clean-cut
shoulders and long stride; Anne, buoyantly collegiate;
Glenn, hatless, and with hair somewhat long and unbrushed,
free in manner and gesture as if he were walking and talking
in a wilderness instead of in the heart of a great city.</p>
<p>Ariel alone would have passed without comment. She was
wearing a heliotrope felt hat&mdash;a present from Mrs. Weyman&mdash;which
shaded the upper part of her face, an English tweed
suit well enough cut to pass muster even on the Avenue, and
one of her ivory-colored silk blouses, open at the throat. The
only thing to attract attention to her was the fact that she
was being swept along by her three rather striking companions,
the obvious center of their exuberance.</p>
<p>Until they were actually in the gallery. There she cut herself
off from the group, and her quiet was no longer the center
of their motion. Hugh knew, as he watched her walking
slowly along the rows of canvases, or standing back for long
minutes to brood on some particular painting, that she had
utterly forgotten him and the other two, for her father&rsquo;s companionship.
He surmised that Ariel was not actually seeing
paintings at all, neither thinking nor feeling in terms of art.
For after all, what did she really know about the technique
of painting, its history or its criticism! Joan had assured Hugh
that Ariel knew and cared absolutely nothing, in spite of her
long association with a great artist, and Hugh had no reason
to disbelieve it. Besides, he remembered Gregory Clare himself
saying in Bermuda that his daughter had inherited
nothing of his gift or interest in art. He had never even tried
to give her instruction in drawing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Even so, she could be enthralled now by these pictures, seen
again after three months of separation. The sky in the pictures,
Hugh imagined, was actual Bermuda sky to Ariel, and
the sea, the ocean curling her own home beach. The light was
dear as her life, home light. She stood, embraced by shore and
sky and wave.</p>
<p>And her own figure up there, dancing in light and shade,&mdash;what
of that? It was the word of her father&rsquo;s love for her. It
was merely his voice saying with the easiness of complete
sincerity, &ldquo;my darling.&rdquo; And in all the pictures around the
walls the artist&rsquo;s love echoed itself in the dancing figure.</p>
<p>So Hugh dreamed, standing near the entrance door and
himself neglecting the paintings to concentrate upon a girl of
flesh and blood.</p>
<p>It seemed odd to him that nobody in the crowds which were
drifting even this early in the afternoon through the gallery
recognized Ariel as the dancer of the pictures. Obviously nobody
did. If she should take off her hat, though, if the May
sunlight should fall on her pewtery hair, would they then
see? Or was she so rapt away into companionship with her dead
father and his imagination that she had attained a kind of
invisibility, except for those who loved her?</p>
<p>Glenn and Anne kept together in their tour of the walls.
Before &ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; given the place of honor&mdash;the only painting
on one whole expanse of wall at the farthest end of the gallery&mdash;they
stopped the longest. &ldquo;Think of this being in our
attic, just lying there in cobwebs and dust, for the past five
years!&rdquo; Glenn muttered. &ldquo;Hugh hasn&rsquo;t a touch of taste, of
course&mdash;he&rsquo;s the typical Philistine if there ever was one&mdash;but
it does seem as if even the Tired Business Man might have
an uneasy feeling&mdash;a sense that there was something, even if
he couldn&rsquo;t grasp it, in the very presence of a thing like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be careful!&rdquo; Anne whispered, pinching his arm and,
with apparent casualness but real concern, glancing around
them to see if any one had overheard Glenn&rsquo;s mutterings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Glenn lowered his voice but muttered on: &ldquo;Can you imagine
how Ariel felt when she found it in the attic? Why, the kid
expected, of course, it would be the first thing her eyes would
light on at Wild Acres. And instead she had to start a hunt
for it! It goes beyond imagination that anybody could do such
a thing to it, even after Joan Nevin had sniffed. Couldn&rsquo;t
Hugh stand up to one little sniff? If he had, he&rsquo;d be in a beautiful
position of <i>I told you so</i> now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Anne defended him. &ldquo;He appreciates
Ariel herself, at any rate. And that takes taste. More than I
had. I had to be knocked down to wake up to it. But I can&rsquo;t
understand what was the matter with Joan. It seems incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn didn&rsquo;t notice Anne&rsquo;s ambiguous allusion to having
been knocked down. It was her implied opinion of the genuineness
of Joan&rsquo;s taste which interested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he pointed out, with a decided sneer in his
voice, &ldquo;that no Michael Schwankovsky had spoken authoritatively
on him yet, and Clare wasn&rsquo;t famous, when Joan had
the privilege of first seeing this masterpiece of his. If anything
ever showed that old girl up, this business does. She&rsquo;s a four-flusher,
that&rsquo;s what she is, a kowtower, a sheep, a total washout.
If she had any taste, even if she personally detested Clare&rsquo;s
way of painting, she&rsquo;d have known this was important. Just as
I detest D. H. Lawrence&rsquo;s stuff, but even without the critics
to tell me I&rsquo;d sense he was genuinely a great writer. I hope I
would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Anne, however, resented all this. She loved Joan less than
Glenn did and with more reason. But if Joan was mean, of
little account, then what of Anne? No. She preferred to think
her rival something better than shoddy. So pride was in it,
and pain too, when she answered Glenn hotly, &ldquo;Joan <i>has</i>
taste, and knows and cares a lot about the things she pretends
to know and care about. Look at her own collection of oils!
And how many people hasn&rsquo;t she made! Brenda Loring, for
instance. And now she&rsquo;s doing everything she can to encourage
Charlie Frye, they say. This picture&mdash;Well, Hugh probably
showed it to her in a bad light and on top of his hundredth
and first proposal. She merely took her boredom out on
&lsquo;Noon.&rsquo; Doesn&rsquo;t that explain it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always stand up for females, Anne, whether you hate
the particular one being criticized or not, I notice. But supposin&rsquo;
you&rsquo;re justified this time,&mdash;then why doesn&rsquo;t the pussy
own up now, say she never got a good look at the thing, instead
of howling all over the place that Hugh never showed
it to her at all? Why is Hugh to be the goat! That&rsquo;s awfully
sporting of her, isn&rsquo;t it! Why! At college any number of
fellows have tried to razz me about it already! I suppose I
owe that to friend Prescott directly,&mdash;to Joan, though indirectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Anne, Prescott&rsquo;s in danger of losing his
diploma, I&rsquo;m afraid, all on account of Joan? I never see him
any more. He&rsquo;s here in New York or at Holly every other
day or so. And even his new novel has gone on the rocks.
He hasn&rsquo;t done a stroke for weeks. Perhaps he&rsquo;s jealous of
Hugh, and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s made such a point of spreading
this story about &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; and Hugh, since the papers all came
out with the exhibition stuff. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the press
will get hold of it any minute now! Wouldn&rsquo;t that be just
silly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Brother and sister looked very much alike at the moment,
absorbed in their individual angers, hands behind their backs,
gazing up unseeingly at the radiant world in the frame before
them.</p>
<p>But the next minute Anne laughed, not without genuine
sweetness, and murmured, &ldquo;Glenn! Take a glance at Ariel.
And forget Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was standing not far off, her face lifted toward a
picture. But she seemed not so much a girl viewing a picture
in an art gallery, as a girl who had come down to a beach of
yellow sands and was standing looking out at a reef with
spray fountaining against it,&mdash;who might, in a moment, throw
herself down there in the sun, and dream. If she did, out of her
body would rise her spirit and dance on the crystal air. Look!
There was the spirit already dancing,&mdash;where the sun in the
picture above threw a white haze across the rocks.</p>
<p>Glenn sang, under his breath,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come unto these yellow sands,</p>
<p class="t">And then take hands:</p>
<p class="t0">Curtsied when you have, and kiss&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t">The wild waves whist,</p>
<p class="t0">Foot it featly here and there;</p>
<p class="t0">And sweet sprites, the burthen bear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And Anne whispered,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where should this music be? i&rsquo; the air or the earth?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; Glenn told her seriously. &ldquo;In Gregory Clare&rsquo;s
painting and in Ariel&rsquo;s very body.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Hugh was coming toward them down the gallery, intending
to hurry them on to &ldquo;The Shell,&rdquo; which was his, and
would soon be hung at Wild Acres. But he halted. He saw
the way Glenn was looking at Ariel. He saw a tenderness and
gravity in his brother&rsquo;s expression that he had never caught
there before. And he turned away. He did not want to see
that expression on his brother&rsquo;s face an instant longer. And
less than anything now did he want to stand in front of that
portrait of Ariel and hear what his brother might say about
it. He wished, with his whole soul, that Glenn would never
come to it, never in his whole life catch so much as a glimpse
of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXV</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Glenn! I thought it was all arranged. That
you had agreed to go as counselor. I didn&rsquo;t know you were
even looking for anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mother! Decker will be better than me as counselor.
And Adams seemed quite glad to get me. It&rsquo;s too good an opportunity
to pass up. I have written the camp head all about
Decker, and the minute he lets me off I&rsquo;m to wire Adams. I
thought you&rsquo;d be rather pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Weymans were finishing dinner at Wild Acres the
night of Anne&rsquo;s and Glenn&rsquo;s and Ariel&rsquo;s visit to the exhibition.
Ariel was dining with Grandam in the attic apartment. Glenn
had surprised the others by announcing his summer plans and
the change he had made in them. In January he had sought
and procured for himself a counselorship at a summer camp
for boys in Canada. But now, it seemed, he wanted to get
onto a paper, and without mentioning it to his family he had
negotiated with Mr. Adams, an editor on the <i>World</i>, for a
job on his staff, and landed it. It only remained to get out of
the counselorship.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Weyman did not look the &ldquo;rather pleased&rdquo; that
Glenn had so confidently expected, and as for Hugh,&mdash;Glenn
thought to himself that old Hugh was looking deuced funny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand all this raised eyebrow stuff!&rdquo;
Glenn protested. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t want me around so
much, well, I can board in New York, and still save something
toward next year&rsquo;s expenses, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Glenn!&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman was looking at him
speculatively. &ldquo;Anne and I&rsquo;ll be in Maine, so you won&rsquo;t be any
burden to us, in any case. There&rsquo;ll just be you and Hugh and
Grandam here. Unless we persuade Grandam to go with us.
But she won&rsquo;t be persuaded. So it&rsquo;ll be you three. Hugh will
be glad enough of your company. I was only thinking of your
obligation to the camp. But if it can be arranged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; Glenn urged, interrupting in his eagerness,
&ldquo;if I am going into journalism, Hugh, this will be
a much more profitable summer? Enderly put me on to the
idea. He thinks it&rsquo;ll be invaluable as experience. I&rsquo;ll be all the
sooner self-supporting if I get some practical experience behind
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Hugh agreed. &ldquo;That is, if you can get out of
the camp work honorably. Grandam and you and I&mdash;and
Ariel will keep house together. Ariel seems definitely to have
made up her mind to stay by Grandam this summer. Keep
her job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan Nevin invited her to go to Switzerland with her. Did
you know that, Glenn? And that she refused?&rdquo; His mother
was looking at him oddly. &ldquo;Is that why&mdash;did she know you&rsquo;d
be here? Did you and she&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman broke off, but
Glenn answered as though she had finished her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said emphatically. But now it was Hugh
who thought that Glenn was looking deuced funny. At any
rate it was the first time he remembered ever seeing his brother
blush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has Joan really invited Ariel to Switzerland with her?&rdquo;
Anne exclaimed. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s not going! Why, Grandam ought
to <i>insist</i> on her going. And you, Hugh! You must make her go.
What a chance! It&rsquo;s just that Ariel is too unsophisticated to
know what it means, I guess. Think of the contacts! Does she
know about Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s colony? How tremendously
swank it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Swank&rsquo; is very much the wrong word,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman protested.
&ldquo;Fashion and money don&rsquo;t help one to get in there.
Authentic personality and accomplishment are the open sesame.
And of course Ariel doesn&rsquo;t understand. How should she! It&rsquo;s
just as well, however, for she&rsquo;d be frightfully at a loss. Joan&rsquo;s
even suggesting it was strange. I know that she did it for you,
Hugh. It was very generous. Shall we have coffee on the terrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s. And dance,&rdquo; Glenn was in an astonishingly social
mood to-night. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get Ariel down and teach her to dance,
Anne. Since she&rsquo;s turned Joan down, it&rsquo;s up to us to do something
for her education, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman said, getting up and
stepping out of the long window onto the terrace. &ldquo;Grandam
can&rsquo;t be left alone for a minute. And Ariel has proved herself
extremely conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Hugh substitute for a little while? Grandam&rsquo;s as glad
to have him as Ariel, isn&rsquo;t she? She&rsquo;s definitely said good night
to Anne and me, and good-by, too. Told us not to come up in
the morning before leaving. But couldn&rsquo;t you release Ariel for
an hour or so, Hugh? Our one night home?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I&rsquo;ve had some coffee I&rsquo;ll go up and try,&rdquo; Hugh
agreed. But Glenn thought his voice now was deuced funny.
Hugh&rsquo;s back was to the lighted dining-room windows, and the
stars did not disclose the expression on his face, but Glenn imagined
it as matching in expression the deuced funny voice.
Glenn had never felt like this before at home. He was aware of
tension, not only in his mother and Hugh, but in himself.</p>
<p>It vanished, however, when Hugh had succeeded in making
the exchange of himself for Ariel with his grandmother, and
Ariel appeared on the terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we have the victrola, or will you play, Anne?&rdquo; Glenn
asked, throwing his half-smoked cigarette into the rose bushes,
and drawing Ariel by both hands along the terrace toward the
drawing-room windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll play, since only two can dance at a time. But I don&rsquo;t
know how Glenn&rsquo;s going to teach you to dance, Ariel, unless
he&rsquo;s been practicing himself lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Glenn confessed. &ldquo;You see, I thought I was going
to get Ariel to Prom. So I&rsquo;ve been brushing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take up the rugs in the library and dance there,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weyman advised, trailing after them, dusky in the dusk.
&ldquo;These flags aren&rsquo;t a good floor. &rsquo;Specially for a beginner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s cooler out here. And Ariel belongs out of doors on
such a night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you will be such children! How is Mrs. Weyman
to-night, Ariel? Do you think she&rsquo;d care to have me
go up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel hesitated, just a breath, and said, &ldquo;Hugh seems to rest
her the most. And I know she feels like only one person at a
time. It&rsquo;s all Miss Freer would let her have, anyway. Miss Freer
has gone for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good nurse,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman murmured. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
see that Grandam leaves her much to do, Ariel. You seem to be
bearing the burden.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only because I rest Grandam,&rdquo; Ariel replied. &ldquo;Miss
Freer would really like to do much more. She considers me officious,
I can see, and is put out sometimes. But it&rsquo;s more important
that Grandam should be contented, isn&rsquo;t it, than that
Miss Freer should approve of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman gasped. Miss Freer had spoken to her several
times on the subject of Ariel&rsquo;s officiousness, but it had not occurred
to either of them that Ariel herself knew how the nurse
resented her. Since Ariel had taken the job of nurse-companion
to her mother-in-law, Mrs. Weyman&rsquo;s respect for her had, of
necessity, grown. Her liking and her interest had grown as well.
Besides, there was Anne, so devoted to Ariel! Mrs. Weyman
sent up almost daily letters addressed to Ariel in Anne&rsquo;s sprawling
hand. Hugh, too, was fond of her, any one could see.
Grandam was absolutely dependent on her. And Glenn! Mrs.
Weyman was disturbed about Glenn. When had he ever in his
whole life before been interested like this in a girl?</p>
<p>Were she and Joan, then, perhaps wrong? Had they made a
mistake from the very first about this artist&rsquo;s daughter in thinking
her a mere child, empty in her total lack of experience?</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s spirited jazz came through the library windows. Ariel
was dancing in Glenn&rsquo;s arms on the starlit terrace. One could
not say she was being taught. From the first step she had merely
followed Glenn and the music. They danced like one person, a
dark and a light figure, slim and rather elegant in the starlight.
Glenn was wearing his tux, and patent-leather pumps. Ariel,
Mrs. Weyman noticed, was not small and insignificant as she
had got into the habit of thinking her. She was tallish and extraordinarily
graceful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even so! Glenn mustn&rsquo;t be serious. It will be years before
he even begins to be self-supporting,&rdquo; Mrs. Weyman mused.
&ldquo;And Joan is probably right. Ariel&rsquo;s charm is merely that of
youth and can&rsquo;t wear. Still, I don&rsquo;t like Glenn&rsquo;s being here all
summer. Propinquity does such absurd things sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And upstairs, Hugh was standing in one of the apartment
windows, listening to the faint thrum-thrum of the jazz from
below. Heard from this distance&mdash;the library windows were
on the other side of the house&mdash;it sounded eerie, faint. And it
kept itself going with an elfish insistence. To Hugh it became
the music of a mischievous fairyland, actually malicious in its
pricking at his heart.</p>
<p>Grandam was lying, too weary to talk or to hear Hugh read,
half drowsing. But she was aware of his mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Ariel&rsquo;s having a little fun,&rdquo; she murmured after
a while. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you, really, Hugh? You&rsquo;re glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course. That&rsquo;s what I want for her....&rdquo; But in the
dimness of her pillows Grandam smiled&mdash;a malicious, elfin
smile, like the far-away music with which she was for the
minute in harmony. A grating in Hugh&rsquo;s voice, the droop of his
ordinarily so squared shoulders, was not unpleasant to her. For
Grandam, Saint Paul was contradicted to-night. In the midst of
death she was in life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>However, Ariel&rsquo;s brief hour of comradeship and fun with
Anne and Glenn was soon over. The next morning they went
back to their colleges until final examinations should release
them. A day or two after that Michael Schwankovsky sailed for
Bermuda, hoping to buy the Clare studio from Doctor Hazzard,
who owned it. To Schwankovsky the studio and the beach
where the artist had lived and done all his painting had become
sacred. He wanted it as a retreat for himself, for the present,
and ultimately to endow and present to St. George&rsquo;s as an altar
to Gregory Clare&rsquo;s memory. But Doctor Hazzard was not to
be hurried in a decision to sell, and Schwankovsky stayed on in
Bermuda, waiting. Joan, since Ariel had decided against accepting
her offer of Switzerland and contact with the rare souls who
would soon be gathering there, paid no more attention to
her.</p>
<p>Now at last was Hugh&rsquo;s best opportunity to relieve the strain
of Ariel&rsquo;s rather arduous days and nights with his friendly interest
and companionship. But for a variety of reasons he did
not use what might have been the golden days. Instead he spent
longer hours at the business of making money. He cultivated
Brenda Loring&rsquo;s willingness to lunch, dine and dance with him
in town, and he was meeting and liking many of her friends.
They were mostly people with whom Joan and Schwankovsky
would not have bothered, and of whom certainly they had
never heard&mdash;young artists and writers and editors, an architect,
a professor from Columbia and so on. Most of the men
were struggling but gifted, and the women without exception
were earning their way and making places for themselves in the
artistic or intellectual life of New York. Hugh felt at home with
these new friends and they were candid in their liking for his
company. After having for so many years been tolerated on the
fringes of Joan&rsquo;s more sophisticated and glittering world of
what his mother called the &ldquo;absolutely arrived,&rdquo; this new experience
of appreciative friendliness was pleasant. And Brenda&rsquo;s
gay friendship and open admiration were more than pleasant.
They were consoling.</p>
<p>So, of Ariel he saw almost nothing. For when he went up to
sit with his grandmother, or play or read to her, as he did as
often as he was at home in the afternoons or evenings, Ariel ran
out for air, or into her own room, in order to leave them together.
But Hugh always thought, &ldquo;She is going to answer
Glenn&rsquo;s letter that I saw on the hall table this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>Joan seldom called him up now, and she was hardly ever at
home, at Holly. For the few weeks before leaving for Switzerland
she was accepting invitations to house parties; so Hugh
saw little of her.</p>
<p>Then, one day toward the middle of June, he received an
invitation to a week-end house party himself, at Fernly, Mrs.
Ronald Hunt-Smith&rsquo;s place on Long Island. As he barely knew
the lady, having met her only once, at Holly, and then only for
a minute at one of Joan&rsquo;s larger teas, he rightly attributed his
invitation to Joan&rsquo;s persuasions. Rather to his own surprise, he
decided against going.</p>
<p>The invitation was in reality, he knew, an indirect promise
from Joan that they should have some long hours together at
Fernly, for surely she would never have bothered to secure so
unlikely an invitation for him unless she meant to manage to
give him a good deal of her time there, as a farewell before her
departure for the summer. But even this assurance did not seem
inducement enough to Hugh, in the new directions his life had
taken this spring, to make him willing to face a household of
uncongenial strangers.</p>
<p>Before he had sent his regrets, however, he learned from
Brenda that she too was included in this house party. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;re asked for Joan,&rdquo; she said, frankly annoyed at the idea.
&ldquo;And I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see anything of you. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll go. Oh,
yes, but I must, of course. Business! Mrs. Ronald Hunt-Smith
may have a drawing-room or a boudoir that needs doing over.
And there&rsquo;ll be a dozen or so women of her own sort there, I
suppose, with drawing-rooms just as terrible which I can fix.
No. I can&rsquo;t afford to turn it down, you see. But, Hugh, will you
be a little decent to me, please? I shall be lost among the bigwigs.
They <i>are</i> bigwigs, you know. Not just money, but diplomacy
and high finance. All that. You&rsquo;ll remember that we&rsquo;re
pals&mdash;promise?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I hadn&rsquo;t meant to go. I was going to ask you to come
out to Wild Acres for the week-end instead. Mother is writing
you to-night. But you prefer magnificence and bigwigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;ll come to Wild Acres any other
week-end you ask me, with joy. I think your mother is too
lovely, to want me. I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes from her at the Clare
exhibition. I think I like her already without knowing her,
Hugh. But you will come to Fernly? Say you will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were wistful and pleading. And so, oddly enough,
Hugh found himself yielding to Brenda Loring&rsquo;s persuasions,
where Joan&rsquo;s invisible but encouraging beckon had failed. However,
if he had allowed himself to follow his own desires, he
would have preferred Wild Acres as a place to spend any
Saturday and Sunday. Yes. Even if Ariel must always be in
the next room, writing letters to Glenn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXVI</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And apropos of our little friend Brenda,&rdquo; Joan murmured,
sifting sand in rhythmical waves through her fingers,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she amuses you so much, Hugh dear. If you&rsquo;d played
around with more girls like her, taken out more time for play
and amusing companionships, I mean, you&rsquo;d have been a lot
better off. Brenda wakes you up. Any one can see. And waked
up&mdash;you are delightful, Hugh. All the women here like you
tremendously. And the men, well, they&rsquo;d like you anyway.
<i>These</i> men. They&rsquo;d respect the really clever side of you, the
business side, having most of them come the same road. I did
better than I knew when I wheedled Laura into inviting
you. For really, I was selfishly thinking only of myself, as
usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura was Mrs. Ronald Hunt-Smith, and Joan and Hugh
were out on the swimming beach at Fernly, lingering on after
the Sunday morning&rsquo;s general swimming meet in order to be
together. Joan was wearing a sea-green beach cape draped about
her shoulders and a wide beach hat. But Hugh was sprawled in
the sun, unprotected, getting his first tan of the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brenda&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Hugh replied nonchalantly. &ldquo;Every day
in every way I like her better and better. She&rsquo;s refreshing. And
she wears.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve been able to help her as much as I
have. Laura is thinking of redecorating her Riverside house. Or
she was thinking of it before this party. Now she has definitely
decided to do it. Told me so last night. So you see I still think
of Brenda and for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She owes you this invitation as much as I do, then?
Well, she&rsquo;d be grateful if she knew. She&rsquo;s a loyal soul, Brenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course she owes it to me! Brenda has done some
lovely places, her reputation&rsquo;s grown tremendously. But after
all&mdash;Laura Hunt-Smith! I suppose you can&rsquo;t know what that
means! But to be honest, my dear boy, it wasn&rsquo;t Brenda&rsquo;s career
I was thinking of this time. Not that alone, anyway. I wanted to
see you two together. Every one else seems to have been seeing
you together, and to have jumped to conclusions. I wanted to
see for myself, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, smiling, but an open gay smile, not
enigmatical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;&rdquo; Hugh asked. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that although you two are good friends, you&rsquo;re not
simple enough for Brenda, simple as you are, darling. I mean
she&rsquo;s a little too simple for you. It&rsquo;s too obvious! People are
such imbeciles when they try to evaluate friendships from the
outside! But I, where you&rsquo;re concerned, Hugh, don&rsquo;t come in
that class, do I? We are so close that I can evaluate your relations
with people from the inside, as it were. There&rsquo;s been a <i>rapport</i>
built up between us through these most vital years of our lives,&mdash;fifteen
to thirty, isn&rsquo;t it? We don&rsquo;t fool each other. And no
matter how much you and Brenda flirt, and how openly, I can
only sigh, now that I&rsquo;ve watched you together here, and see that
your heart isn&rsquo;t in it. Poor Brenda! And it might have solved
everything.... I mean, you stood some chance of normal
happiness if you could only have found her <i>simpatica</i>. But you&rsquo;ll
never bring yourself to marry any one without that. Oh, you
see, I know&mdash;I know....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>Hugh leaned up on one elbow and started scooping out a
trench in the sand between himself and Joan. His dark head,
silhouetted against the vivid blue-green of the noon Atlantic,
was Grecian, Joan thought, in its beautiful symmetry. And his
shoulders were as classic under the narrow straps of his damp
bathing suit as they appeared when hidden under the most
meticulously tailored of dinner jackets. &ldquo;Fastidious strength.
Strength to be used fastidiously. Aristocracy of body&mdash;as it is
hardly known in the modern world,&rdquo; Joan mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s mine. I&rsquo;ve only to reach a finger across this trench.
Whisper one word. What am I waiting for? Why can&rsquo;t I take
him as he is, and not expect perfection? Why do I want the
moon? What do I hope for, better than this! If Michael and
Hugh and Doctor Steiner could only be rolled into a composite
person, that would be ideal. But they can&rsquo;t. Hugh&rsquo;s
himself, and couldn&rsquo;t be himself and have all their qualities
added. And why must I cling to this perfectionist view of my
life! Ah! That is still to be discovered. But why wait to understand
myself perfectly? I needn&rsquo;t stop being analyzed just
because I&rsquo;m married. And it isn&rsquo;t as if marriage were irrevocable.
It isn&rsquo;t. Though of course one does hate to make mistakes,
for marriage is important. At the very least mistakes with
it are a waste of time. But it&rsquo;s pride, really. I&rsquo;m as proud as
Lucifer and can&rsquo;t bear to be caught out in a mistake, important
or unimportant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Joan was talking for Doctor Steiner in these musings. She had
almost forgotten the presence of the occasion of them, and Doctor
Steiner&rsquo;s emaciated face with its piercing but impersonal
eyes was before her, in her imagination, more vivid to her than
Hugh in the flesh. He was probing with herself into the depths
of her psyche, watching with a whole mind&rsquo;s powerful concentration
for the one word that might turn the lock, explain to
them Joan&rsquo;s inability to live life as the majority of people do
live it, discover the mystery of why she, almost alone in the
world of civilized women, felt that if she could not give herself
in her entirety to a marriage she could not give herself at all:
in other words, that compromise was beneath her.</p>
<p>Doctor Steiner had often drawn her attention to the fact that
compromise is the attitude necessary if one is to lead a normal,
rational life. The gods, if there are gods, may live without it,
but not mortals. Joan must forget her Luciferian pride, learn
to be an ordinary mortal, if she hoped for happiness.</p>
<p>Last night she had dreamed, and written it down with minutest
detail in her dream notebook kept for Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s
eyes alone, something which might help him to understand,
more than any other dream she&rsquo;d had since being analyzed, the
secret of this inability to stoop to compromise with life. It was a
dream which, given almost any interpretation, flattered Joan&rsquo;s
soul very much. She could hardly wait for Doctor Steiner to hear
it and by its illumination pierce a little deeper with his so divinely
impersonal vision into her mysterious depths. Indeed, she
found herself looking forward to to-morrow afternoon, and the
two hours he would give her in his office then, with a vast impatience.
Would that it were here! After all, what could Laura
Hunt-Smith&rsquo;s house party offer in competition with two hours
of Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s active interest in one&rsquo;s complicated soul
states!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>But Doctor Steiner&rsquo;s keen face was beginning to disintegrate
and form again into Hugh&rsquo;s obtuse one. Hugh had completed
his trench and was interrupting Joan&rsquo;s train of absorbing
thoughts by talking. And about Brenda Loring! Stupid of him!
Joan was tired of Brenda. She herself had exhausted that subject,
and here was Hugh keeping it up. He was saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no question of sentimentality between us. Brenda and I are
friends. And she has no more designs on me than I have on her.
That&rsquo;s one of the things I like about her. She&rsquo;s so finely independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not so independent as you think! She&rsquo;s only human,
dear boy, even if she does make fifty thousand or so a year out
of that way she has with interiors. But I&rsquo;m not pretending to understand
Brenda. It&rsquo;s only you I know so well. And I do think
it may be rather a pity that you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to be fonder
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He responded nothing to that, and after a little she leaned
forward and destroyed his trench, smoothing it out with her
fingers. She was giving him her attention again, Doctor Steiner
practically forgotten. She decided to speak gravely and simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, dear! I&rsquo;ve already lived. Had a life. My adorable children!
They have satisfied the maternal in me. Filled my cup to
overflowing. And I am deeply satisfied. I wouldn&rsquo;t want more
children, even if I married. That side of me is finished. Perfected.
Do you see? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for you&mdash;far better&mdash;if
you could fall in love with a wholesome, healthy girl
who still wants and needs all that for her development? I don&rsquo;t
say Brenda. I see she wouldn&rsquo;t do. She&rsquo;s not quite wonderful
enough.... But some one quite wonderful.... If you could
find her.... Don&rsquo;t you think it would be kinder of me, even if
I loved you, to give you up once and for all? Today! Now! For
your sake?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>She was looking at the smoothed plateau where the trench
had been between them. If Doctor Steiner had been there,
actually in the body and not merely hovering in the background
of Joan&rsquo;s obsessed imagination, would he have noticed a contradiction
between what Joan&rsquo;s hands had just done in so ruthlessly
destroying Hugh&rsquo;s trench and the noble womanly kindness
of Joan&rsquo;s words? And supposing he had noticed the work
of Joan&rsquo;s hands, would he have called it the outward sign of an
inward conflict; or would he&mdash;for even a psychoanalyst, no
matter how bigoted, cannot be totally ignorant of human nature&mdash;have
thought privately that here hypocrisy of a very
simple order had accidentally symbolized itself? Perfectly self-conscious
hypocrisy, at that?</p>
<p>She was looking at the smoothed plateau and not at Hugh, yet
she felt that his dark gaze was raised, burningly, to her face.
But she was wrong. Hugh was looking neither at her nor at
the plateau her beautiful fingers were still smoothing and
smoothing. He was looking into space. And he asked, with as
grave a voice as she had used, and every bit as quietly, &ldquo;Do you
really and finally mean this, Joan? Are you telling me to give up
hope of you? And would you be glad if I could find some one&mdash;wonderful&mdash;and
she would be so simple and dear as to
marry me, and we should have children? Do you mean this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>There was something of a pause. Joan lifted her gaze from
the sand with a slight surprise in it. But Hugh&rsquo;s face was averted.
She guessed the pain in his eyes. Well, perhaps pain was what
she had asked for, more than passion, in what she had just conveyed
to him. She said with an intended beautiful frankness,
&ldquo;No, my dear. I&rsquo;m quite normally selfish. Every one is, you
know, but most people are capable of rationalizing their selfishnesses
into looking like nobilities. Well, being psychoanalyzed
destroys in one, if he co&ouml;perates with the discipline, the possibility
of this comforting variety of self-deceit. It has destroyed
it in me, at any rate. So I cannot say to you what would only be
a lie. I cannot be so dishonest, Hugh, as to tell you that your
falling in love and marrying and having children by some one
you thought very wonderful&mdash;more wonderful than me&mdash;would
make me glad. How could it? It&rsquo;s very pleasant to be
adored. And I love your love. This is true of me emotionally,
you understand, my dear. But one cannot act in harmony with
his emotions all the time unless he has the facility, which I,
thank God, have not, of rationalizing them eternally. No, Hugh,
dear. It is the findings of my sane, free mind that I would share
with you in this. And that mind says, &lsquo;He would be far happier
married to almost any one than to you, Joan Nevin. He needs
the great experience of having children of his own, and of being
adored, as he adores you.... If you are generous, you will
help him to this deliverance, Joan Nevin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused. She put her hand near his hand on the sand. She
looked at it, and finished in a low, quite beautiful intonation,
&ldquo;Dear boy. I love you enough to be frank with you. And I do
believe if you could find such a woman, and make such a marriage,
that our friendship would be only deepened by it. I love
you, in my own way. But, frankly, it is not a way that is good
enough for you. That love, such as it is, you can never lose.
Your marriage with some wonderful person&mdash;only she <i>must</i>
be wonderful, Hugh, or I should be unreconcilable&mdash;might
even deepen it. I think, Hugh, I could love the very children
she gave you, for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the distinctions you make, Joan, between
your sane mind and your emotions. But you are saying that you
want me to give you up? You are advising it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Joan did not hesitate. Although their hands were not touching,
she sensed the vibration of some passionate emotion through
his whole body. And now she was ready for climax. She had
built up her scene. She had used her sane mind in the way that
Doctor Steiner admired so much in her, that beautiful detachment
and frankness of which so few women are capable. Already
Doctor Steiner had encored her performance, in her imagination,
and would certainly do so again in actuality when she
told him the whole story to-morrow afternoon. But now she was
a little tired of all that. Life is many-sided. The ideal life is one
lived on all its sides. Rhythm is the fundamental law of life.
So now let come emotion. She would <i>feel</i> again. The sun and
the salt air on her lips was not quite enough of sensuous comfort.
She would invite Hugh&rsquo;s hard, passionate, bitter kiss. Her
veins were hungry for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hugh darling. I want you to give me up once and for
all. Only I want it&mdash;it would break my heart if you failed to
understand this!&mdash;because I do truly love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent her head and waited for the storm. But it held off.
Hugh had sat up and was looking out to sea. He said in an even
tone&mdash;iron control, Joan thought he was showing&mdash;&ldquo;That is
the way you love me? Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a very dear love, Hugh, isn&rsquo;t it, to put your happiness
ahead of my own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh suddenly turned over and lay prone in the sand,
stretched to his full length, his face on his folded arms. There
was a space when he might have been dead. He was lying in
the dark. Darkness of body, darkness of soul, darkness of mind.
Time was lost. Then he felt the shore under him. Earth. And
the sun on his back, on his neck. Out of death he had been
tossed up&mdash;onto the shore of life. He lay, light as the dark
waves that had swept him here, and buoyant with peace. Clean
swept of all the dark. Purged of desire too. He was on a new
shore. A new existence opened to him, a free man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have had violets.&rdquo; He remembered Ariel so
vividly, standing before him in the white coat, her voice and
face passionately earnest. It was the only time he had ever seen
her passionate about anything, except that close-shut stone-like
passion of anger against Joan that Sunday, when Joan had
brought Schwankovsky to call and had let him blame Hugh for
&lsquo;Noon&rsquo;s&rsquo; having been relegated to the attic, and said no word
about her own part in it. That was passion, if you like, but
shut-in, angry.... &ldquo;I would rather have had the violets,&rdquo; that
was passion outflowing. Beautiful.... Daring.... But he
had given Joan the violets, and, he had thought, for all time.
Now, however,&mdash;glory be! Joan had tossed them back. Definitely.
Finally. They were his to give again....</p>
<p>Joan touched his shoulder, lightly, pityingly. He started, for
he had forgotten she was there. He looked at her with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! I thought I was alone!&rdquo; He mumbled it like a boy
who is caught day-dreaming by an elder, and with the same
flushed shamedness. And then, in his more natural voice, &ldquo;I
say, excuse me, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queer expression that swept Joan&rsquo;s features was not intelligible
to him. But instinctively he knew that he had never
seen its like before in her face. It was the shadow of a strange
consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forgot I was here!... Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was imagining things,&rdquo; he tried to explain, and made it
worse than it need have been. &ldquo;Kid stuff.... Desert islands,
adventure.... New lands, you know.... I thought&mdash;&rdquo; But
he saw that he was offending her, and struggled for something
else to talk about. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he blurted, &ldquo;does this sunlight remind
you of Clare&rsquo;s? It does me. And the green of that water!
It&rsquo;s Bermudian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s head and shoulders were turned away. He had trouble
in catching her words. She was saying, &ldquo;Crowell Fuller was
telling me last night at dinner that he thinks we&rsquo;ve vastly over-rated
the importance of Gregory Clare. He bought two of the
paintings himself and grants he&rsquo;s important&mdash;but not so important.
It&rsquo;s a pity, and Michael will be disappointed. For Fuller
could hold up Michael&rsquo;s hands so substantially, if he only saw
eye to eye. He&rsquo;s the one person&mdash;over here&mdash;in a position to.
And he&rsquo;s not doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was cool, impersonal. She might have been talking to
some one she had just met at a tea, except for that turned-away
shoulder, the averted face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does it really matter&mdash;now?&rdquo; Hugh asked, genuinely
surprised. &ldquo;The Metropolitan&rsquo;s bought a bunch of &rsquo;em. There
were none left untaken after the third day of the exposition.
Ariel has more money from them than even her father dreamed
of,&mdash;enough, if it&rsquo;s managed at all well, to secure her a free,
even opulent life by ordinary standards. So what can Crowell
Fuller or any other person do now to spoil things? You&rsquo;re certainly
borrowing trouble, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swung on him angrily. At last he had given her a cause
for anger which she could openly acknowledge. And Hugh,
obtuse, did not dream that the fury now directed at his head
was not caused by his last remarks at all, but by what had gone
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>Her voice was splintered with anger, all the lovely intonations
splintered and lost. &ldquo;I thought Gregory Clare was your
friend. After all, you were the first purchaser he ever had. And
now you can so <i>stupidly</i> say that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what place
he&rsquo;s to hold among American painters! Nothing matters, I take
it, except the money that his dear little daughter&rsquo;s pulled from
the sale. I tell you that Gregory Clare, dead, is worth a million
of Ariel Clares living. A million&mdash;million! But now that she
won&rsquo;t have to drudge for a living, it&rsquo;s no matter to you what becomes
of Clare&rsquo;s wonderful art. You are content. Complacent.
Very exhilarating!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed with what sounded like bitterest scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put me too much in the wrong, Joan. I won&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;
Hugh, too, could lose his temper. &ldquo;What I really feel, and
<i>know</i>, is that you nor I nor Crowell Fuller nor Schwankovsky
nor anybody on God&rsquo;s earth, in the last analysis, will have a
damned finger in the ultimate fate of Clare&rsquo;s work. Justice goes
its own ways, with art as with souls. And don&rsquo;t let any one tell
you it isn&rsquo;t so! If Clare&rsquo;s paintings are really important (God!
how I hate that word, used as you patronizing intelligentsia
are using it these days!), the importance will win through for
itself, without your worrying about it. That&rsquo;s what I believe,
anyway. Always <i>have</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s jaw dropped perceptibly. But her eyes kept their angry
glitter. &ldquo;That is a decision, my friend, which I believe even the
greatest philosophers haven&rsquo;t dared to make. Personally, I have
never supposed that there is a god of art who deals out ultimate
justice, willy-nilly. It looks pretty much a matter of chance&mdash;and
of friends, and advertising. I&rsquo;d say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>But Hugh interrupted her, still hot. &ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s
a life, a soul of its own in a picture like&mdash;&lsquo;The Shell,&rsquo; for instance.
It&rsquo;s a life that will, come spring, burst through into humanity&rsquo;s
appreciation, the way buds burst through bark, come
their spring, to light and air. For the imagination is strong, like
love.... It is a power.... Yes. I&rsquo;m willing to leave my
friend&rsquo;s works to their own destinies. So long as imagination is
organic in them, as it is in Clare&rsquo;s pictures, then they&rsquo;re potent
in their own right as is a bolt of electricity. Even if some poor
fool hides &rsquo;em away in his attic, or even if fire burns &rsquo;em or
water drowns &rsquo;em,&mdash;justice still works with &rsquo;em and for &rsquo;em....
For Beauty is&mdash;<i>must be</i>&mdash;as immortal as goodness....
Though we don&rsquo;t see how, or understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with people.... With people&rsquo;s personalities
I mean. Their &lsquo;importance,&rsquo; since you like the word so well. If
they have any importance&mdash;<i>beauty of spirit</i>, <i>Soundness</i>, are my
terms for it&mdash;it bursts a way for itself, like buds in the spring.
Environment and accident haven&rsquo;t got power over it. Not a bit.
It can&rsquo;t be kept in, held back, any more than birth itself can be
held back, once it gets going.... And Ariel&rsquo;s got that thing in
her personality,&mdash;that <i>soundness</i>, <i>beauty</i>, <i>importance</i>. Beauty&rsquo;s
organic in her character....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s whole face was burning, and his words came out staccato,
fierce with conviction. Joan, almost miraculously, she felt,
had the insight to realize that at least part of this amazing passion
of conviction was impersonal. She saw that Hugh was really
talking about such things as imagination, love, personality, abstractly,&mdash;out
of deep-seated convictions which had grown in
him with his own growth, and which she had never suspected
in him. Why, he was a man with a religion, and she had never
guessed! But she preferred to pretend to think him moved by
personal emotions merely, and asked bitingly, &ldquo;Then what is
your plan for Ariel when your grandmother dies? Have you
changed your mind about her so utterly as it appears, and you&rsquo;ll
let her be a second Isadora? Express this wonderful personality,
this beauty of spirit of hers, in some world-shaking way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>Hugh dropped back to natural. He was ashamed of so having
betrayed his soul&rsquo;s convictions to Joan&rsquo;s skepticisms. &ldquo;I shall
have nothing to say about it; why should I? But of course that
wasn&rsquo;t what I meant at all, or anything like it. Ariel&rsquo;s far too
ordinary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s mind reeled. &ldquo;Oh, but surely not. After all you&rsquo;ve said!
Ordinary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo;s&rsquo; the wrong word, of course. But you know
very well what I mean, Joan. She&rsquo;s not artistic. She has nothing
in her of the genius, or the artist. Or rather, her genius is her
personality. I thought I said it all before. She&rsquo;s of the spirit....
<i>Love</i>&mdash;<i>Life</i>.... It would be rotten to turn it into dancing. All
that <i>life</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem at all descriptive of that child to me,
Hugh. She&rsquo;s about the quietest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about liveliness. Well, look at the sun, here
on the back of my hand. Still, isn&rsquo;t it? Quiet? But it&rsquo;s life!
Ariel&rsquo;s quiet is like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was silent, quiet herself for a minute. But not the kind of
quiet Hugh had just explained to her. She asked, finally, &ldquo;Are
you sorry, then, that her father has advertised Ariel, as he has,
in his pictures? Do you think it is cheapening? And would you
think that being a famous dancer would cheapen her? Is that
what you&rsquo;re afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>He hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I used to feel that way,&rdquo; he acknowledged.
&ldquo;The first time it was suggested that Ariel might get all
this publicity she has been getting, I did think it a shame. I
wanted to protect her from it. But I&rsquo;ve outgrown that angle of
it. I know now that that&rsquo;s a false, inherited attitude. Not sound.
You yourself, Joan, let Enderly and those other literary fellows
vote you the most beautiful mother in the East for the Ideal
Perfume Company, Inc., the other day, and your picture&rsquo;s even
in the subway entrances now, and in the advertising sections of
every magazine, that&rsquo;s worth the name, I&rsquo;ve picked up this
month. I&rsquo;ve had to get over the prejudice, you see. And I&rsquo;ve succeeded,
I think. No, it isn&rsquo;t that at all now that convinces me
that Ariel shouldn&rsquo;t go in for dancing. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joan cried, laughing shakily, &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think publicity
is cheap, and what&rsquo;s convinced you is because I&rsquo;ve allowed it?
So I still am a criterion, Hugh? Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. I&rsquo;m <i>glad</i>. And Hugh, I gave the money to the
home for Crippled Children. That&rsquo;s what made me consent to
the silly business,&mdash;that, and the help it might just possibly be
to Prescott&rsquo;s sales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! But I knew it was all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only see here, Hugh! Have I been too stupid? You aren&rsquo;t going
to tell me that that&mdash;that girl whose name you can&rsquo;t keep
off your funny old tongue is the wonderful person we were talking
about, when we agreed that you ought to marry some one
else, and have children of your own? I&rsquo;m not going to believe
that, even if you say so. It simply couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh put out a hand as if to push something strongly away.
Joan might have seen suffering in his face now, if she had
known when and how to look for it. But his voice was his ally.
It did not betray him as he said, &ldquo;Hardly! Haven&rsquo;t I told you?
It&rsquo;s Glenn who&rsquo;s in love with Ariel. Any one can see....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not need to go on, for she took it up so eagerly. &ldquo;No,
really! But you&rsquo;d never let Glenn, would you? Why, your
mother would be wild. And you,&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t like it yourself,
would you, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not. You know how I feel about Ariel. And
I believe rather deeply in early marriage. But I doubt whether
Glenn realizes wholly how it is with him yet. You mustn&rsquo;t say
anything, Joan. I trust you. Youth is so easily&mdash;wounded by
too many words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! She <i>should</i> have gone to Switzerland with me! It
would be too bad, if you&rsquo;re right! Glenn&rsquo;s only twenty! And
he&rsquo;s going to be dreadfully clever&mdash;fascinating, when he
grows up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud, thin and ragged, was obscuring the sun. Hugh had
lost his desert island where life was new and possibilities unlimited.
He did not slip back into the dark waves. He knew he
would never be tossed drifting there again. He still was free.
Life still was new. But the warmth and the joy were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s chilly. Come&mdash;&rdquo; Joan was on her sandaled feet first,
making a pretense of pulling him up by his hands. Her peace,
so violently threatened in the past minutes, was established
again. She would see Doctor Steiner at least once more before
she made Hugh utterly happy. But she was&mdash;she knew it now&mdash;through
with being a perfectionist. This chill in the air! The
loss of the sun! It all spoke a word to her which she had heard
but without realizing before. It said that she was thirty, and
that life was running away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Brenda won&rsquo;t bless me
for monopolizing you like this. Just the same, let&rsquo;s steal away
for a walk late this afternoon, do without tea. Shall we? There&rsquo;s
a heavenly walk I know here, partly through the woods and
partly along the shore. And we won&rsquo;t quarrel again. I promise.
Do you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She strode beside him like a goddess in the freedom of her
bathing dress, her cape blowing back and away out in the new-sprung,
chill wind. She had pulled off her shade hat, and
her hair shone, even in the chill light, live and beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>Mrs. Ronald Hunt-Smith and Brenda Loring were taking a
gossipy stroll in the rose garden when Hugh and Joan came up
from the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, my dear!&rdquo; Mrs. Ronald Hunt-Smith exclaimed under
her breath to the girl by her side, as the bathers drew near. &ldquo;Did
you ever see anything so radiantly perfect! They are a Greek
god and goddess. And against that sea! Beautiful! I can&rsquo;t understand
why dear Joan holds off so. Eventually two creatures
like that&mdash;so perfectly matched&mdash;must come together. Isn&rsquo;t it
obvious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda gave the Greek god and his goddess barely a glance,
before looking beyond them to the sea which was their background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s obvious,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;Too obvious to be
true. Some things are, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXVII</span></h2>
<p>Late afternoon. Glenn walked up the avenue at Wild
Acres, back from the first day of his job on the <i>World</i>. It had
been a long day, beginning at seven in the morning. He looked
and was weary and disheartened, and his mouth was set in a
rather bitter line. Anne, lying in a long chair in the square garden,
the only patch of ground, except for a bit of lawn, which
was cultivated at Wild Acres, saw him through the screen of
hedge which protected her privacy, and sat up. &ldquo;Glenn,&rdquo; she
called softly, &ldquo;oh, Glenn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He responded to the call dispiritedly enough, but came
around the hedge and sat down on the foot of her chair when
she had moved her legs to make room for him. She handed him
a cigarette and then held a match for him. She herself had
been smoking for hours, it seemed, for the grass all around
her chair was littered with cigarette stubs thrown carelessly
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How goes it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated, then looked at her gloomily. &ldquo;Have you seen
the morning papers?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The <i>Times</i>. But there&rsquo;s hope for him, it seems. And it
may have been only&mdash;only a temporary aberration. I&rsquo;m upset
too, Glenn. But there&rsquo;s nothing we can do. Or will you try to
see him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>Brother and sister looked startlingly alike in their anxiety and
disillusionment. There were deep rings under their eyes and
the general pinched and worn look that can come, even to the
very young, from a long day of anguish. The morning papers on
their front pages had carried a blatantly headlined story of the
attempted suicide in New York the night before of the young
novelist, Prescott Enderly. Failure in getting his degree at Yale
was the suggested cause, but there were added some pointed
hints at a love affair with an &ldquo;older woman.&rdquo; And Glenn had
been assigned to write a more detailed story for the evening
edition of his paper, because he had known Enderly at Yale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adams sent me to the hospital to get the latest on it,&rdquo; he
told Anne. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me see him. He&rsquo;s delirious, anyway.
He may lose one eye. It was a bell boy who caught him
in the act and jogged up his arm. The bullet just grazed the
brow and went through the ceiling. It was the smoke that got
the eye. Ass! Not to lock his door! Some bell boy! Nerve, that
kid had. I got his story too. Don&rsquo;t know why he had to butt in,
though! Pressy&rsquo;s not thanking him any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn&rsquo;s face was as white as the petals of the paper narcissus
blowing in the June breeze by the side of the long chair. Anne&rsquo;s
eyes were black with pain. They were both breathing fast. Short,
nervous breaths.</p>
<p>After a minute Anne muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over it and be
happy yet. He&rsquo;ll go on and have a good life. See if he doesn&rsquo;t!
It was Joan, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know? Yes, it was. But don&rsquo;t say it to a soul.
Promise? He saw her in town after he learned he&rsquo;d lost out at
Yale. He said something to frighten her. Must have, I think.
She saw he was desperate, anyway. And she refused to see him
again. Cut him right out. I knew he&rsquo;d written since and called
her up. He told me this was what he&rsquo;d do too,&mdash;blow his brains
out. But I&mdash;fool&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t believe him. Anne, I laughed at
him. Didn&rsquo;t help him any.... You see I simply can&rsquo;t imagine
any one being so desperate he&rsquo;ll do a thing&mdash;like this. I can&rsquo;t
yet, as a matter of fact. But if I&rsquo;d <i>had</i> the imagination, I might
have saved him. It&rsquo;s worse now, it seems to me, than as if he&rsquo;d
succeeded. Ghastly humiliating, unless he tries again and does a
clean job next time. I was a damned fool. I am a damned
fool.... I failed him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne held her cigarette case toward Glenn again, pulling
one out for herself at the same time. Glenn lit his from the stub
of the one about to burn his fingers, and kicked viciously at the
clump of paper narcissus blowing beside them, there in the
June garden. Anne&rsquo;s eyes followed the kick sympathetically.
Her hands, clutching the arms of the long chair, were shaking.
And she had thought she was going to be calm when Glenn
came home!</p>
<p>All that morning, from the time she had happened upon the
<i>Times</i> headlines soon after breakfast, she had tramped&mdash;she
didn&rsquo;t know where&mdash;in woods and fields. And all the afternoon
she had lain here, exhausted, smoking cigarette after
cigarette, watching the light change across the lawn and garden
and the edges of the woods, and waiting for Glenn. Ariel
she had avoided, rather than hunt her out. For Ariel had done
for her, Anne, what there had been nobody to do for Prescott.
And Anne almost resented that she had had an Ariel to go to,
when Prescott had had no one. If Anne herself was any good,
Prescott would have had her, as she had had Ariel.... If she
had been understanding.... If she had been able to break
the snare of her own blind, egoistic passion and had not driven
him away from her by clutching at&mdash;what never comes for
clutching.... How terrible to be deaf and dumb and blind
with passionate love&mdash;and to lose that way all the possibilities
of friendship and its salvations!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>And now, even if the beloved ever came sane,&mdash;and, blind
in one eye and shattered, should undertake to face the world
again and its bitterness, it would never be Anne who would
help steady him to it. It would be Glenn, perhaps. And, looking
at the paper narcissus which had sprung erect again with delicate
vitality from Glenn&rsquo;s kick, she made a resolution that Glenn
must not know to what a degree she was suffering over the
plight of&mdash;his friend. Why, one of the reasons for Prescott&rsquo;s
breaking with her was his desire that Glenn should never know
how far their affair had gone. He had valued Glenn&rsquo;s comradeship
mountains above Anne&rsquo;s stupid, egoistic passion of love.
And he was right to do so. One thing she could save from the
wreck of what might have become a fine, even a lovely, human
relationship with Prescott: she could save Prescott&rsquo;s self-respect
with her brother and incidentally, but not primarily, for truly
she was not thinking of herself in the old way any more, her
own self-respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan&rsquo;s called off the dinner to-night, I suppose,&rdquo; Glenn muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I know,&rdquo; Anne said, keeping her voice from
shaking with better success than her hands. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think
she will. In fact, I hope she won&rsquo;t. For both Hugh&rsquo;s and Ariel&rsquo;s
sake. And why should she? She&rsquo;ll pretend, don&rsquo;t you think, to
be absolutely out of all this business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I suppose she will. But, of course I shan&rsquo;t go. And you
needn&rsquo;t either, Anne. After all, you were fond of him too. You
can say you&rsquo;re cut up, as I shall say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Suddenly he turned and looked at her with a sharpness that
almost broke down her defenses. &ldquo;And I believe you are. Of
course you are. You and Pressy were quite pals. Anyway, I know
he liked you tremendously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;m going, no matter what, Glenn! For Ariel&rsquo;s
and Hugh&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn&rsquo;s face softened at this repetition of Ariel&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Why
for their sakes?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why should they be so keen on eating
dinner at Holly this particular night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after all, Ariel hasn&rsquo;t been outside of Wild Acres for
several weeks. She&rsquo;s getting a little too tired. She&rsquo;s thin. Anybody
can see. Besides, it&rsquo;s the poor darling&rsquo;s last chance to see Michael
Schwankovsky for months. He&rsquo;s going to Switzerland next
week, and then to Russia. And the party&rsquo;s a celebration in honor
of the exhibition, you know. So, of course, Ariel must be looking
forward to it. And Hugh&mdash;Well, Joan&rsquo;s off herself, to-morrow,
for her Switzerland colony. I have a hunch&mdash;have
had it all day&mdash;that to-night may be Hugh&rsquo;s last chance. If
she goes away without their settling anything this time&mdash;he
might just as well give up. So&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to the party anyway.
You come too, old thing. For Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything in life for Ariel,&rdquo; Glenn responded quietly.
&ldquo;And if she goes I want to go, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glenn? Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, it is really. But it oughtn&rsquo;t to be. It&rsquo;s so idiotic of
me, isn&rsquo;t it? Two years more at least before I&rsquo;ll be making anything
decent, if then. And she deserves a man. Not a boy. If
old Prescott had only gone off his nut for her instead of for
Joan, I could&rsquo;ve understood it. But then, if he had, I should
all the more have wished him better success with his target practice.
Oh, Anne! I am a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>He buried his dark head in his hands. His shoulders shook.
Anne prayed through clenched lips that he would not cry out
loud. But she understood his sudden loss of control. His crying
had nothing whatever to do with Ariel, she knew. The thought
of Ariel, whom he would in all probability win and marry, was
only joy to him. It was what he had said about &ldquo;target practice&rdquo;
and his friend. He was appalled at his own brutal words.</p>
<p>She said in a matter-of-fact voice&mdash;but her face was set in a
womanly and even noble mask above Glenn&rsquo;s bent head&mdash;&ldquo;It
will be you and I, and Mother, and Hugh, and Ariel, and
Michael, and Charlie Frye and Joan, and that&rsquo;s all to-night. If
Joan does decide to marry Hugh you&rsquo;ll have to forget about
her and Prescott, you know. And if she decides not to marry
him, and will only be so kind as to tell him so to-night, then
neither of us need ever have anything to do with the creature
again. No reason to. We can forget her even before she has
taken the trouble to forget us.... Let&rsquo;s go in and give ourselves
good old soapy baths now, doll up, and see it through.
Come along with big sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to Anne&rsquo;s and Glenn&rsquo;s expectations, though, Joan
pretended neither indifference nor ignorance concerning Prescott
that night. Her first words to Glenn were words of sympathy,
and she took pains to let him guess that her hostess manners
this night were covering a grieved and very troubled, even
a contrite, heart. Glenn actually found himself being sorry for
her. After all, she had never encouraged Prescott to think that
he counted especially with her. Remembering this, and Prescott&rsquo;s
open hopelessness as he stated it, Glenn was boy enough
and susceptible enough to be softened by Joan&rsquo;s beauty and the
pathos in her eyes, as she stood holding his hand that brief
minute of their whispered interchange of troubled words in her
wide hall at Holly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; he heard himself muttering
sincerely. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t believe he meant what he said,
any more than I could. If you only knew, Joan, you&rsquo;re not so
much to blame as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Hugh was near enough to hear. And Joan turned to him,
drawing him into it. She said with something which had the
similitude of harsh grief, &ldquo;Youth itself is to be blamed for this
terrible thing. Do you remember, Hugh, weeks, months ago,
my telling you that young men in love were frightening? The
middle-aged were safe? They do not kill themselves for romance.
It is your generation, Glenn. Yours&mdash;and Anne&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne had caught this, and for a minute she thought that Joan
had raised her voice for that very purpose. Had Prescott, then,
told Joan that Anne too had wanted a way out of life, and almost
found it, because of youth and love? But Ariel alone knew
that. And Anne&rsquo;s sordid secret was as safe with Ariel as it
would be with the Wild Acres woods, or with the sky, had she
made her confidences to either. Anne was certain.</p>
<p>She turned away from Joan&rsquo;s group, hard, austere. Glenn
might be won to Joan by her beauty and charm, in spite of her
terrible part in the tragedy of his friend. Hugh might marry
Joan. But Anne knew at that moment that she herself would
never again, after this night, be able to bear the sight or the
sound of her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s horrible,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;A glutton of love.
A walking sore of vanity. It isn&rsquo;t jealousy that makes me see
her this way. Even to be loved by Prescott I would not be anything
like Joan Nevin. I&rsquo;d rather Prescott never gave me a
thought again through eternity than have any touch of that
stinking vanity, scarring my voice and face as it scars Joan&rsquo;s
to-night. I&rsquo;m the only one who <i>sees</i>. She&rsquo;s horrid, rotten.&rdquo; And
she went over to stand with Michael Schwankovsky and Charlie
Frye and Ariel before the painting of Gregory Clare&rsquo;s which
Joan had bought for herself and which now hung between the
long windows in the drawing-room, where the party was to
wait for the announcement of dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>But even here she could not escape Joan&rsquo;s echoes. As Anne
joined the group, Charlie Frye was saying, &ldquo;... wonderful! Of
course, she knows, just as we all know, that it&rsquo;s she young
Enderly went off his head over. She goes on with it all, though.
Entertains us. It&rsquo;s magnificent of her, I think. But she&rsquo;s pale to-night....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne gripped Ariel&rsquo;s hand hard and cried with stifled violence,
&ldquo;Merely a matter of leaving off rouge! Very effective
too,&rdquo;&mdash;and wanted to bite her tongue out when she had said it.
Michael Schwankovsky looked at her, whether disgusted or
quizzically she didn&rsquo;t know. <i>Or care!</i> Charlie Frye bit his
lips to keep an angry retort back, and frowned at the floor. But
Ariel threw an arm about Anne&rsquo;s shoulder, and Anne felt that
she was trembling in unison with her.</p>
<p>The long windows leading onto the terraced rose-garden were
open throughout dinner. Candlelight, moonlight, rose scents
and the glowing colors of the other women&rsquo;s evening frocks
were all mingled for Ariel in a web of sensuous pleasure
which mixed with a mind almost as anguished as her friend
Anne&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Schwankovsky occupied the head of the table, where he
played host spectacularly, with a noisy zeal. Ariel, in whose
honor the party had been planned, was given the place of honor
at his right. Mrs. Weyman was opposite Ariel at his other side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Glenn on Ariel&rsquo;s right remembered poignantly the first meal
she had had with them, how she had been as silent as now, but
with a different silence. Then she had bent with the flow of
talk as forget-me-nots bent in a grassy stream, flowing with it,
not obstructing it. But to-night she was withdrawn, on purpose.
And she looked often at Anne, Glenn noticed, with a tender,
watchful regard. Why, Glenn could not imagine, for Anne by
this time was entering into everything exuberantly, as she had
promised him and herself she would. Charlie Frye, quite over
his earlier irritation with her, was merry as a grig. Anne was
flirting with him, a little clumsily, perhaps, but effectively, if
one judged from the man&rsquo;s reactions. What Glenn did not
notice, but Ariel did, was that Anne, on the evening when Joan
Nevin had left off her rouge, had painted her own face most
brilliantly.</p>
<p>The talk flowed on. Chatter about summer plans, their own
and other people&rsquo;s. Gossip about Doctor Steiner who had just
been given a degree by conservative Harvard. Would he go to
make his home in Vienna next year, as he was threatening, or
stay to enrich America with his knowledge and genius? Some
desultory discussions, too, of music, plays, books and painting.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in a way that he intended to be confidential and
intimate but could not make so because of his size and the timbre
of his voice which even when consciously lowered compelled
the attention of the whole table, Schwankovsky leaned to
Ariel and took her wrist in his fingers. &ldquo;My own darling child,
you are <i>triste</i>. At this, your own party! But, believe me, some
day very soon, it will be forgotten.... You&rsquo;ll be rid of grief....
Your old friend knows.... And grief so pure as yours
is pure, unstained by remorse, leaves no sediment of heaviness
when time has once flowed over it and past. It is a good fortune
to have youth and grief together. Some day you will think
so.... This is a very beautiful aquamarine, Ariel!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>He lifted her hand higher, and looked long and delightedly
at the heavy silver ring with its beautifully colored and flawless
stone, which Ariel was wearing.</p>
<p>Ariel wanted to cry, &ldquo;Oh, Michael! It isn&rsquo;t missing my father
that makes me so out of things to-night. And please forgive me
for not playing up when we owe you everything, my father and
I,&mdash;and you are going away so soon! It isn&rsquo;t grief. It&rsquo;s something
else. For I can&rsquo;t be brave, the way Anne is brave. I am
frightened, do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was indeed frightened! For Ariel, like Anne, had a conviction
that to-night things were to be decided between Hugh
and Joan. She only said, however, calmly enough, conscious of
the waiting silence of the others, &ldquo;Grandam gave me this ring
just to-night. The color is wonderful, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the setting! It&rsquo;s a rare and beautiful setting! But it is a
man&rsquo;s ring! It cannot belong to you, my Ariel! It is much too
heavy for this little hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to hold her wrist and stare down, fascinated, at
the lovely ring.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was leaning across the table, amazed. &ldquo;Grandam
gave you her aquamarine, Ariel! I hadn&rsquo;t noticed you
wearing it. But she values it above everything she possesses, except
that pencil drawing of the hands. I don&rsquo;t know what its
association for her is, or why she always wears it. She&rsquo;s avoided
telling us. Did she give it to you, or just let you wear it, Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;She gave it to me,&rdquo; Ariel replied, but her own words, her
answer to the simple question, rang in her ears like a knell.
Her blood went icy. For suddenly she knew the significance
of the ring, and the significance of Grandam&rsquo;s having given it
to her. And yet no one had told her. This ring had been worn
on one of those pictured hands, on the hand that was to open
the coach door for Grandam when she got out in Eternity. That
holy hand had given the jewel to Grandam as its last act on
earth. And now Grandam had passed it on to Ariel. And all
Grandam had said was, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a keepsake to match your green
feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Father&rsquo;s green feather.... Grandam&rsquo;s and the Saint&rsquo;s aquamarine!</i>
Oh, pray God Grandam hadn&rsquo;t meant Ariel to understand
a swift farewell in the casual, sacred gift. Pray God! Pray
God! Did Grandam think she was about to die?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXVIII</span></h2>
<p>Ariel started to rise from her chair, her face gone wan
and strange. But she sank down again. Her heart was beating
leaden beats. How <i>could</i> she know that this ring had belonged
to the possessor of those hands, now dust, and how could she
know that Grandam&rsquo;s time to die had come! It may have been
some glance toward the pictured hands, as Grandam slipped
the ring from her finger and gave it to Ariel, unnoticed then
but impressed somehow all the same on Ariel&rsquo;s memory, which
let her know to whom the ring belonged. But the conclusion
that Grandam had given it to Ariel because she was now to die&mdash;that
was unreasonable. Ariel clutched her napkin in tense
fingers and tried to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman was saying, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right, my dear. It&rsquo;s
only that I&rsquo;ve never seen Grandam separated from her ring before.
Since she gave it to you, she wants you to have it. It is
only another sign of her affection....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>Schwankovsky, as well as Mrs. Weyman, had been startled
by Ariel&rsquo;s air of shock, and now the big man said soothingly,
&ldquo;Every one has affection for my Ariel. Of the deepest. Old Doctor
Hazzard, did you know, is saving your studio in Bermuda
for you? The more I offered him for it, the surer he became that
you, my child, would have need for it in time. When I told him
of the success of the exhibition and tried to show him that you
were financially independent, now, he was not changed. By
his will the studio is to become yours. He says, and perhaps
truly, for he is wise in some ways, that man, that the paintings
themselves are the things to make pilgrimages to, not the
place where they were made. He says that the studio was a
home first, and a studio second. I came away having accomplished
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan, at the foot of the table, shrugged and met Michael&rsquo;s
eyes with sympathetic humor. &ldquo;It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle than for one of these Philistines to
comprehend the artist&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; she put in. &ldquo;Poor Michael! All
your journey for nothing! A home before it was a studio!
Lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Not for nothing. And not &lsquo;lovely&rsquo; either! I had a
rather rich week, Joan. Enlightening. And Doctor Hazzard
himself was well worth the trip. He is coming to visit me this
fall. We have become friends. And if he is a Philistine, then a
world of Philistines would be a Utopia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I misunderstood you. I thought you needed sympathy!&rdquo;
She turned to Charlie Frye and asked, shutting the rest of the
table into the abysses of outer darkness by the intimate fall of
her voice, &ldquo;Did you know this Doctor Hazzard when you were
in Bermuda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schwankovsky retained Ariel&rsquo;s hand and stared like a seer
into the cold green clarity of the semi-precious stone. Glenn
felt shuddery and resentful. Why ever did Ariel let the great
creature go on petting her in that absurd way? He might be
the great Michael Schwankovsky, famous for his wealth, his art
collections and his books, but Glenn refused to be hypnotized
by such considerations into overlooking his boorishness. It was
hideous of him to have spoken to Ariel about her grief like
that&mdash;before everybody! Both insane and inane. He was an old
sentimentalist too. And all this pawing&mdash;!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>But Ariel seemed to like it. And, in fact, she did. Michael
Schwankovsky&rsquo;s warm, strong, great hand holding her wrist
with such gentle firmness was regulating those leaden heartbeats
back to normality. Kindness and <i>soundness</i> were transmitted
through those strong, firm fingers to her consciousness.
From her very first meeting with Michael Schwankovsky she
had felt at home with him. And by now, quite simply, she had
come to love him very much. Glenn could understand nothing
of this. He sat between Ariel and his brother, trying not to care
that Schwankovsky was keeping Ariel physically prisoner by
that wrist, trying not to hear what seemed to him the mawkish
tenderness in the booming voice that shattered, to his senses,
against Ariel&rsquo;s delicate reserves so unforgivably.</p>
<p>And Hugh was thinking, &ldquo;This is going to be an awful evening!&rdquo;
It stretched away before him, a desert of aridity, where
Ariel would be kept close at Schwankovsky&rsquo;s side, his mother
and Joan would discuss psychoanalysis and the comparative
merits of its different schools endlessly, and Anne, Glenn and
this Frye fellow would keep the radio going over all. If it fell
out that way, he could not go on with it. His nerves were taut.</p>
<p>And then those taut nerves hummed like telephone wires in a
storm as he caught the look of tortured disgust on Glenn&rsquo;s features
as the boy&rsquo;s eyes turned from Ariel&rsquo;s prisoned wrist.
&ldquo;What right has Glenn to care like that!&rdquo; Hugh cried to himself.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too young to know really how to love her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>But after dinner, to Hugh&rsquo;s vast relief, the radio was overlooked.
It was a warm, still, moon-flooded night, and as a matter
of course the entire little party wandered out to the terrace
and settled itself in garden chairs there. Only Joan sat on the
balustrade, leaned her shoulder against an urn, and beckoned
Hugh with her lighted cigarette to come beside her. She was silent,
in spite of being hostess, and he was silent with her for some
time, while the others talked. To Joan, the silence between herself
and the figure so close to her side was pregnant as none of
their other silences had ever been. It was the darkness in which
her moment of surrender was germinating. She had told Doctor
Steiner at their final conference on the subject this morning that
she was going to give marriage with Hugh at least its trial.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weyman had taken it upon herself to play hostess for
the so unusually obscured Joan. And Joan blessed her future
mother-in-law for that. But for all her activity, Mrs. Weyman
was not so oblivious as she appeared to be of the two very quiet
people withdrawn there from the social group in the dark
shadow of the great urn. Her eyes wandered in their direction
constantly, and she was deeply excited and hopeful. She, like
Anne and Ariel, had her &ldquo;hunch&rdquo; that to-night might make
Hugh supremely happy. Meanwhile, she was doing her best
to keep the social atmosphere from requiring Joan&rsquo;s attentions
by being particularly entertaining herself; and this in spite of
Glenn&rsquo;s unhelpful somberness, Anne&rsquo;s staccato and unnatural
cheerfulness, and that strange creature Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s
bearish gambolings. Ariel was not counting, so far as Mrs. Weyman
was aware, either for or against her efforts at harmonizing
the little group. She was too elusive out here by moonlight,
where her voice, flat and pebble cool, was heard only now and
then in some quite commonplace, careful answer to somebody&rsquo;s
direct question to her. In Charlie Frye she found her stand-by.
Mrs. Weyman put him down, once and for all, in her mental
notebook this night as a perfect filler-in for future dinner parties
at Wild Acres.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Ariel!&rdquo; Schwankovsky boomed suddenly, interrupting
Charlie Frye in a really amusing anecdote he was
telling. &ldquo;The time has come when you must dance for me.
I will make the music. We shall not be together again for
months. Unbearable to think it! So for my consolation you are
to dance now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arm around her shoulder, he was drawing Ariel into the
lighted music room and toward the piano with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ariel! How delicious! Please do,&rdquo; Anne cried, jumping
up and turning over her chair in her relief at something at last
happening in the breathless atmosphere of the terrace. And she
followed them in, leaving Charlie Frye&rsquo;s story hanging in mid-air,
just as it was, half told. Mrs. Weyman could do nothing to
rescue his anecdote for the embarrassed young man. She could
only get up, with him, and follow the noise into the drawing-room,
where they sat beside each other, two defeated social captains,
on a little Queen Anne sofa, just inside the long window
through which they had entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be interesting. Do you suppose she will?&rdquo; Joan
asked, out in the dark, putting her hand through Hugh&rsquo;s arm
and edging him along the railing to a better view of the interior.</p>
<p>Schwankovsky was playing MacDowell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Water Lily.&rdquo;
Ariel was sitting on the end of the piano bench, while Anne bent
over her, begging her please to dance, and Glenn stood before
her, adding his urgings. Then suddenly Anne was kneeling
before Ariel. She was stripping off Ariel&rsquo;s silver slippers and her
stockings.</p>
<p>Hugh moved abruptly, and Joan&rsquo;s hand fell lifeless through
his arm and to her side. Hugh was striding toward the windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>Ariel was his, in a manner, after all. Her father had given her
to him in a way that made his concern imperative. And this
was all simply crazy. Schwankovsky was just an insufferable
buffoon. And Anne and Glenn were idiots&mdash;</p>
<p>But Ariel was standing, straight and unabashed in her violet-blue,
wood-smoke dress that was made from Grandam&rsquo;s scarf,
the folds of the skirt falling about her bare legs, her high-arched,
slim feet very white against the gray velvet rug that covered the
floor in there.</p>
<p>Hugh halted inside the window. Schwankovsky was saying
with almost an hypnotic look and voice, &ldquo;Forget all about us,
my Ariel. Even the music. Remember your beach, and the
smooth floor of sand down between the rocks. Remember the
loggia and the path through the cedars. Remember the violets
and the roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was playing &ldquo;The Water Lily&rdquo; as he talked, but stopped
and changed abruptly into something that might be C&eacute;sar
Franck&rsquo;s, but nothing of his that Hugh knew. Hugh had not
realized before that Schwankovsky could play,&mdash;and play like
this! The big man was looking beyond Ariel, as if he himself
saw the clouds, the beach, felt the rhythms of earth, sky and
water, that were pouring through his music. Hugh could not
go forward. He dared not break into the Forces of Beauty which
even he, Philistine that he was, could feel gathering in that
room.</p>
<p>Ariel started walking away from the piano, slowly. She was
coming directly toward Hugh, but it was obvious that she did
not see him, or the others there, against the wall of the room.
She was walking forward into the world which Schwankovsky
had given her back suddenly, when she was unhappiest and
needed it most.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>And Mrs. Weyman and Charlie Frye, Anne, Glenn, Hugh,
and even Joan&mdash;out on the dark terrace&mdash;were being drawn
with the slow pacing of those bare feet over the gray rug into a
simple state of harmony with&mdash;the cosmic rhythms? Ariel
drew them with her, Ariel and Schwankovsky&rsquo;s music together,&mdash;drew
them forward, forward, out&mdash;out&mdash;out beyond
the confines of the room, even farther than the boundaries of
their individual desires and passions, into a state of identification
with the intentions of the universe. They were, all of them,
pressing forward along with Ariel&rsquo;s poised, spiritualized body,
her bare, sure feet, and the music,&mdash;straight into the heart of
Beauty....</p>
<p>When she began to dance, she did not dance <i>to</i> the music.
She danced <i>in</i> it. In the music, moving in it as if she were the
fire at the heart of its purity, she danced to Life. First it was
elemental life, the rhythms of earth, sky, water. Her face stayed
immobile. She was as impersonal as the music. Only her body
spoke. Much of the time her head was dropped, so that the immobile
features were shadowed in her hair, as in the pictures
where her father had painted her dancing. This was at the
beginning of the dance....</p>
<p>But as Ariel had walked from Schwankovsky&rsquo;s side and out
onto her home beach, and there unified herself with the rhythmical
universe, soon she moved forward again into a new aspect.
She danced still from within the music and at one with rhythms
of earth. But now she was dancing before the Face of Love.
She danced before the Face of her love of her father, who had
painted her dancing. She danced before the Face of his present
happiness, in which she believed utterly. She soon danced before
the Face of her own grief and loss.... She danced before the
Face of her love and comradeship with Grandam&mdash;Grandam,
who now was coming close, close to the edge of life....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>Finally, she danced before the Face of her religion, her belief
in love, in life, in the life beyond death.</p>
<p>This was all so personal and poignant that Hugh would have
had to turn away and not go on watching if it were not that
Ariel&rsquo;s dear face remained impassive. It might have been carved
from still jade, white and luminous, but impassive. Or, no,&mdash;it
was like the face of a flower whose expression a self-enwrapped
mortal cannot read. Hugh was grateful with his whole heart
that Ariel&rsquo;s face was only a flower floating on the stream of the
dance.</p>
<p>The music poured on. Crystal. Exalted. Pure. And fiery.</p>
<p>But the eyes in the white jade face were waking, were getting
to be seeing eyes. The pale mouth trembled. Light trembled
at its sharp uptilted corners....</p>
<p>Hugh was frightened. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t. Oh, Ariel!&rdquo; his heart
cried, loud enough for hers to hear, he should think, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
it through into your face. <i>Don&rsquo;t let them see your soul!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two children&rsquo;s heads, one topping the other, peering from a
fold in the hall porti&egrave;res, were what had brought the expression
into the dancer&rsquo;s face. Persis and Nicky were being naughty.
Escaped from Alice&rsquo;s care&mdash;or perhaps Alice was there too
in another fold of the silk hangings&mdash;in their nightgowns, just
as they had left their beds, they were watching Ariel dance in
their mother&rsquo;s very drawing-room, as they had so often watched
her dancing in Wild Acres woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>Ariel did not look at the children again. She would not give
them away. But that glimpse of them had changed everything.
Persis and Nicky had counted on her finding the beginning of
the magic path in the woods for them, the path which would
lead to fa&euml;rie. It was to begin with a clump of yellow and white
violets. A hidden way. A secret way. The secret of the yellow
and the pearly little flower faces. But she had not found it yet.
Might she find it now? Bless them! She would try.</p>
<p>She knelt in the center of the gray rug, and looked for a
clump of white and yellow violets. She pushed the damp, dead
leaves of last summer&rsquo;s woods away with firm but not repudiating
fingers. And there, behind the sheen of the flower-faces she
had uncovered, she did discover the secret, hidden way to
fa&euml;rie.</p>
<p>Rising, she turned to take the children&rsquo;s hands. The path was
here, and they would walk it now together. The three walked
out the path through light and shade, their faces set toward
fa&euml;rie.</p>
<p>The watchers of the dance saw children with Ariel then, as
clearly as if they were really there. And if they did not know
exactly that they were on their way to fa&euml;rie along with Ariel,
they sensed something very like it.</p>
<p>Ariel and her invisible dance-children came to a sunny clearing.
There, in a circle of happiness, they began walking slowly
round and round in fa&euml;rie. Until they stopped&mdash;to wait and
listen in fa&euml;rie. Then, and then only Ariel bent her head to look
into the faces of her dance children.</p>
<p>But it was not Persis and Nicky&rsquo;s faces that gave her back her
look. Here were two dark, thinner faces. Greek in their perfection
of feature. High-held, narrow heads, they had. And the
dark, soft eyes of their dream-lighted faces were Hugh&rsquo;s eyes
over again.... <i>Hugh&rsquo;s eyes, in children&rsquo;s faces</i>!</p>
<p>The dance went to shatters. Electric light tore away the sunlight
from the clearing. And as though the music had been rays
from the dance, it faded, thinned away.... A drawing-room
remained, and a group of moved and almost unstrung people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>Ariel, standing still, startled by her vision of the dark, aquiline
little faces of those terribly beloved dream children, looked about
almost wildly for Hugh. And she found him leaning against
the jamb of one of the long windows. He was looking at her,
waiting for her eyes.</p>
<p>Ariel knew that the others were there somewhere, as well,&mdash;even
that Michael was coming toward her from the piano. She
knew where she was. She knew who she was. But in that instant,
even with the dance shattered for her, she was too much at one
with her soul to keep her secret longer. And Hugh&rsquo;s face, for
any one who could bear to look on such heart&rsquo;s nakedness, told
as much as hers. There flashed between them, across half the
length of a room, terrible and startling as lightning, the mutual
promise of love&rsquo;s consummation.</p>
<p>Then Ariel blushed. Red swept from the tip of her chin up
over her face. She was no longer a fairy-tale girl. Her cheeks
seemed rounder, her smile for Anne who had rushed upon her
with shrieks of praise, was not light-tipped and eerie. It was
warm, merry. Not until Michael Schwankovsky fell to kissing
her forehead and her hands with rapturous joy over her performance
did the blush fade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXIX</span></h2>
<p>Every one was exclaiming the same thing. &ldquo;Genius! Isadora
was never so wonderful! Ariel Clare, why didn&rsquo;t you do
it for us before!&rdquo; Every one except Hugh. He had got himself
out of the room into the summer night, and, invisible himself,
stood looking through the open window at Ariel, the center
of the charmed, noisy little crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wrong,&rdquo; Joan was using the occasion to try on
generosity, as an ordinary mortal might try on a new hat. &ldquo;You
know, my dear, I have been guilty of murmuring that you were
just a normal, nice girl for whom we must find a husband. Your
career should be motherhood. And all that. All the time Persis
and Nicky could have told me better. But I thought your dancing
with them was only a game. Now, my dear, I&rsquo;d pay you dollars
a minute if you&rsquo;d teach my babies how to walk, kneel, move,
dance. You did intend us to see children there at the end, didn&rsquo;t
you? Michael! Isn&rsquo;t she too wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Ariel. You can put on your stockings and slippers
in private.&rdquo; Arm through her friend&rsquo;s arm, Anne was pulling
Ariel toward the open window. They did not see Hugh
there as they came out, although Ariel&rsquo;s wood-smoke frock
actually brushed his knees in her passing. They sat down at
the top of the steps going down from the terrace, while Ariel put
on her stockings and slippers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ariel! You&rsquo;re lucky! Lucky! You&rsquo;ll be a great dancer.
You&rsquo;ll have a career. So it really won&rsquo;t matter to you whether
your heart breaks or not. A person with genius like yours is
safe, forever and forever. If I only had some gift, some art! I&rsquo;d
never be afraid again. I know I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne!&rdquo; Ariel sounded amazed at Anne&rsquo;s lack of understanding.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any art. And I&rsquo;m not going to be a dancer.
Ever! In there, nobody knows anything about me. But I thought
you knew. As long as I live, I shall never dance when grown
people are around again. Never&mdash;Never.... I shouldn&rsquo;t have
done it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slippers were on. Ariel stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home now.
Do you think Glenn would drive me, and then come back?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? It&rsquo;s your party, in your honor, and it&rsquo;s not ten
o&rsquo;clock yet! Joan will be furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel lifted her hand and pressed the cold aquamarine against
her cheek. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay away from Grandam any longer,&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Not to-night. She may be needing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course Glenn will take you. Your excuse is pretty
weak, though. Rose has often stayed with Grandam before
and got along all right. You haven&rsquo;t by any chance got a hunch,
have you, that Grandam does literally need you? The air is
positively electric to-night. I&rsquo;ve a strong hunch myself that Joan
and Hugh are at last going to get engaged. Glenn and I are in
cahoots to keep old Schwankovsky and Mother and Charlie
amused, and give Hugh his chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was suddenly there with them, materialized from the
shadows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you home,&rdquo; he said authoritatively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>Although the girls had not known that any one was near
them on the terrace they did not start at the sudden apparition.
&ldquo;I heard you, Anne,&rdquo; Hugh added. &ldquo;And <i>your</i> hunch, at least,
is wrong. Joan definitely ended things last Sunday at the Hunt-Smith&rsquo;s.
As it happens, we&rsquo;re both very happy about it. Thank
you all the same, and Glenn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he addressed Anne, he was looking at Ariel, and
Anne, even by moonlight, caught the quality of that look.
She drew in her breath sharply. So that was it. And she
hadn&rsquo;t dreamed. God help Glenn then, and on this day of all
days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course you&rsquo;re not going so early!&rdquo; Joan, visibly non-plused,
refused to see Ariel&rsquo;s hand held out for good-by. &ldquo;Why
should you, so early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel looked down at her aquamarine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have to,
Mrs. Nevin. Grandam may need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely not. Did she ask you to break up the party so
early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;But I must&mdash;So, good night. And thank you very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well then. So sorry. Glenn, you&rsquo;ll drive Ariel home
and come back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Joan put it as a command.</p>
<p>But Michael Schwankovsky boomed, &ldquo;I shall be very happy to
take the rest of the Weymans home in <i>my</i> car, if Glenn <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>
get back. Youth, Joan, youth!&mdash;No! This is not our &lsquo;good-by,&rsquo;
my Ariel. I shall put you into the car carefully, right beside your
young man. Not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan was trying to catch Hugh&rsquo;s eyes, but he was looking at
Ariel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking Ariel home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sorry, Glenn.&rdquo; But his
voice was vibrant. His face, his voice&mdash;together with Ariel&rsquo;s
pale, victorious face&mdash;told a great deal. But Joan shrank back
from understanding what was becoming plain to most of the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>She urged sharply, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll come back. You&rsquo;ll only be gone
ten minutes or so. I want a long, quiet talk with you to-night,
Hugh. Our last, perhaps, for months!&rdquo; She was very white. But
Hugh did not take his eyes from the top of Ariel&rsquo;s head, which
was all he could see, for her face was bent quite down and she
was still looking at the aquamarine. He replied, and it sounded
absent-minded and was certainly casual, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have that talk
to-morrow morning, Joan. Your boat doesn&rsquo;t sail till midnight.
I&rsquo;m counting on quite a wonderful walk and talk with you in
the woods to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes?&rdquo; Joan knew now, but did not admit to herself, that
she had lost. How could she acknowledge that she had anything
to fear from this pale girl, who stared at her silly ring when she
could look up and see Hugh Weyman&rsquo;s very heart in his eyes
bent on her? Had Hugh ever looked at herself like that? She
could not believe he had. If he had, then she had been a fool&mdash;a
fool! She felt her ego shrivel. It was like a spent dandelion
flower, dried into fluffy seed, blowing to the four winds.</p>
<p>When Ariel, after long ages, to Joan&rsquo;s aching sensibilities,
lifted her gaze from the aquamarine, withdrew herself from
those distant, eerie, Bermudian depths, Joan made no more of
her even then; for the eyes she lifted were crystal,&mdash;blind with
tears. What in heaven&rsquo;s name was the girl crying about? Crying!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>Hugh found Glenn beside him when he went to get his car.
And suddenly, as they crossed the wide sweep of gravel toward
the parked roadster, Hugh came to earth again, for a minute.
His heart smote him. His love for Ariel had been gradually, all
the spring, making him more sensitive to the world about him
and other people. And now he sensed possible suffering. He
turned on Glenn and gripped his shoulders in the summer
dark. &ldquo;Glenn, old fellow! Are you in love with Ariel?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>There was only the hint of a hesitation before Glenn said
carefully, as if he wanted Hugh to hear every word and remember
it forever, &ldquo;Does one fall in love with a poem? A star?
Dawn? Ariel to me is all imagination. She&rsquo;s in my soul, somehow.
But not as woman.... I saw her look at you, Hugh....
At the end of the dance, you know. So I know that you two&mdash;that
you two&mdash;Well! That&rsquo;s only the shadow of Ariel you&rsquo;ve
got. An accident. Her earth side. The impersonal and beautiful
is left for me. I&rsquo;m not jealous. I&rsquo;m not&mdash;suffering....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you! Yes. It&rsquo;s the woman I want, and that I&rsquo;ve got.
The wife. The mother....&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on to the car. Joan was waiting on the lowest stair
under the portico, when they drove it around to the door, and
Ariel had not yet broken away from Michael Schwankovsky&rsquo;s
farewells on the top step. The big voice was booming, &ldquo;And
next winter we&rsquo;ll make a dancer of you! Divine! Better than
Isadora ever was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel laughed. &ldquo;No, Michael. No, no. I shall never be a dancer.
I may dance for you, if you will play again. Because you are not
grown up and don&rsquo;t embarrass me. I don&rsquo;t mind you any more
than I mind Persis and Nicky. You&rsquo;ll dance with me. But you
can&rsquo;t ever make me into a dancer. Dear Michael!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see about that. We shall see. When I come back I
shall take care of you. I shall teach you to be ambitious. For the
sake of art, I must do that, my child. Art cannot let you off, let
you go. Not with such genius! I am no artist myself, you see,
but I am militant for it wherever there is cause. It is religion with
me. So, as I discover your father&rsquo;s pictures, so I discover you.
Not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>Joan drew Hugh into the shadow of a pillar. &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s raving
again,&rdquo; she whispered intimately, her breath at Hugh&rsquo;s
cheek, her perfumed scarf falling against the back of his hand,
soft, mothlike. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fatherly raving. <i>We needn&rsquo;t worry!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the intimately whispered &ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Joan was
trying desperately to identify her interest in Ariel with Hugh&rsquo;s
interest. She was determined to marry Hugh now, not merely
resigned to it. And her cue, she thought, was partnership in
his responsibility for Ariel. She would pretend genuine concern
for the girl, even fondness, if she must. She was ready to
do, to be anything&mdash;if only in return the scattered seeds of her
vanity and pride could be blown back again into their brilliant
flower pattern.</p>
<p>But Hugh scarcely heard her. He was listening to Ariel&rsquo;s
laughter and to Schwankovsky&rsquo;s exuberant flattery and affection
up by the door. And then&mdash;oh heavenly!&mdash;to Ariel&rsquo;s
voice, pebble-cool:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never on the stage! But always for you, when you want.
When you come to visit us&mdash;me.&rdquo; But she had meant &ldquo;us,&rdquo; and
Hugh knew that &ldquo;us&rdquo; meant <i>them</i>, himself and Ariel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... To-morrow then? A walk in the woods? I&rsquo;ll have something
quite wonderful to tell you, Joan dear.&rdquo; He had not understood
her whispered surrender. And he was not aware that
she had taken the end of her scarf from his fingers and was
wrapping her bare shoulders now as if she were cold.</p>
<p>She tried only once more. &ldquo;Hugh! Suppose I don&rsquo;t go to-morrow!
I&rsquo;m quite out of the mood to-night. Why should I
go? With Holly never so beautiful, and all my friends, my
<i>dearest</i> friends, here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>His answer to that astounded her, in spite of all that had
happened to her ego this night, by its simple cruelty. &ldquo;I know
it! Why should you go? It&rsquo;s heaven on earth right here. Why
should any one leave it? This night is&mdash;I never knew a night
like this! It is wild&mdash;it is <i>wild</i>, Joan dear, with beauty and wonderfulness!
I wouldn&rsquo;t go to heaven to-morrow if all the angels
invited me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood away from him. &ldquo;Hugh! Are you aware of me at
all?&rdquo; she cried, but under her breath. &ldquo;Do you realize that I
said I might give up Switzerland? <i>And why I should want to
give it up?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holly, you said, is so beautiful.... But Joan....&rdquo; He was
appalled. But then, before he allowed himself quite to understand
her&mdash;and he had very nearly allowed that misfortune to
them both to happen&mdash;he said quickly, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think of
me, my dear. Or pity me. Ever! You were awfully right in all
you said at Fernly. Remember? And our friendship, yours and
mine, <i>is</i> going to be deeper and sounder than ever. It is enriched.&rdquo;
And then, forgetting her again, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s
enriched. Even the moonlight. It&rsquo;s magic, isn&rsquo;t it, Joan?
Wild with loveliness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he got finally off with his Ariel, Hugh remembered
that Glenn had lost his latchkey lately and not replaced it yet.
So he&rsquo;d better find him&mdash;he seemed to have vanished into the
house&mdash;and give him his. He did not interrupt Ariel and
Schwankovsky in their protracted farewells up at the door, but
went around by the terrace to enter by the drawing-room windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>Frye was at the piano now, in Schwankovsky&rsquo;s place, his head
bowed over the keys, his eyes shut, playing a blues. Anne and
Glenn were dancing to it. But Hugh did not go in. He stood,
struck into wonder by a wholly new aspect he was suddenly
vouchsafed of his brother and sister. They were not his little
brother&mdash;his little sister. No. The weird, heart-rending &ldquo;blues&rdquo;
had turned them into a type&mdash;into its own note, its wail. They
were figurines&mdash;pale&mdash;beautiful with grief.... Aristocratic,
narrow heads held high.... Their chiseled faces Benda masks.
Every motion of foot and leg and the wandlike bodies was heart-rending
with passion and grief&rsquo;s restraint....</p>
<p>Perhaps love had turned Hugh clairvoyant. Perhaps acute
happiness does that sometimes. But whatever the cause of the
illumination of his sympathy, he realized Glenn and Anne as
noble, beautiful. And for one flashing instant he saw, typified
in them, the pain of Youth itself.</p>
<p>He did no more about the key, but turned back to the car,
awed and quieted. He did not understand precisely what had
happened to him by this quickening in his soul of the power of
insight. And above all he was not conscious of any concrete
reason there might be in those two particular lives for his compassion.
All that he knew definitely was that he had looked with
naked eyes on the fortitude of youth.... He himself had
never been so clear-cut as were Anne and Glenn. He had
hoped and pretended his youth away. Glenn and Anne would
go on dancing through their youth, dancing over its pains and
anguishes, wand-held, reserved, with intricate steps.... Their
eyes open.... Perfectly self-conscious.... But dancing still&mdash;with
all the discipline of a patterned art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>The minute he was in the car beside Ariel he forgot them.
The big house and all it held was blotted out in shadow at their
backs, and their path cut itself ahead through moonlight. But
neither spoke. Ariel sat well over at her own side of the wide
seat. Hugh watched the road and guided the wheel. As they
neared their avenue it never entered Hugh&rsquo;s head to suggest,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on, up the river.&rdquo; Although the road was a wide path
of sheer moonlight, and the silvered river raced at their shoulders
like an Angel of Lovers. For he knew that Ariel&rsquo;s heart held
one intention&mdash;to get to Grandam. From the minute when, at
dinner, Schwankovsky had drawn attention to her ring (except
for the swift bright period of the dance), this had been true.
So he raced the roadster in under the dark arch and up the moon-laced
wood road through the glimmering birches and beeches,
around the silvery-dark curves to the door. There he spoke the
first words that had been uttered since they were alone together:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drive the car around yet, but go up to see Grandam
with you, Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they ascended the steps,&mdash;the three, shallow, wide steps
to Wild Acres&rsquo; home-promising door,&mdash;Hugh was shy of Ariel.
He longed that she should turn her face, look at him, speak to
him. But Ariel was afraid of Hugh. She had said too much. She
had said everything there ever would be to say, with her eyes,
when she looked up from those heads of the dark dream-children,
and found his dark eyes&mdash;so like, so terribly like&mdash;on
hers.</p>
<p>Besides, here was the aquamarine on her finger, clear in the
moonlight. And before she gave herself to Hugh, Grandam,
her beloved friend, was to die. Things must come in their order.
If she raised a hand, if she breathed too deeply, something might
be shaken out of God&rsquo;s beautiful intended order for it. All life&mdash;and
birth and death&mdash;was so delicately balanced, it seemed,
here, in one girl&rsquo;s heart!</p>
<p>Hugh had his latchkey in the lock. But the door was not
opening. Surprised at that, Ariel did turn and look up at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>She stepped back&mdash;suddenly&mdash;away from what she saw.
But he followed and took her into his arms. She leaned back
against his arms, held herself back and away from his body, but
her face remained lifted to his. By moonlight he saw that it was
as expressionless as when she had danced, expressionless as
the face of a flower is expressionless&mdash;to mortal eyes&mdash;and
strangely silver, bent back this way against his dark coat sleeve.
But although she was leaning back and away from him, he felt
no weight on his arm. Her body was held with the dancer&rsquo;s self-sustaining
poise. Then he knew what he had only believed
before: she was the eternal dancer, but not to music. Hers
was the dance to life. His beloved&rsquo;s whole genius was for living.</p>
<p>Gently, he drew the poised, free body toward him. There was
no blindness of engulfing passion here, only two wills, free as
day, rushing fleetly upon one another. No red flames roared
against a dark mind-misery. Only sunrise breaking about the
whole circle of his soul&rsquo;s horizon. Heaven&rsquo;s dawn.</p>
<p>Grandam saw their faces and bodies radiant with that dawn
when they came into her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is here in time for me to see, and to be happy with you!
But just in time!&rdquo; she told them with a quick breath.</p>
<p>Rose, who had stayed with Grandam until Ariel&rsquo;s return,
had left; and now that she was gone, Ariel ran forward and
dropped on her knees by the low bed, and kissed Grandam on
the lips. Sunrises, kisses. Hugh sat on the other side of the bed,
and to-night Grandam did not make him get up and bring a
chair. Instead she gave him one of her hands to hold. &ldquo;How did
you know, Grandam?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I never told you we were in
love. Did Ariel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither of you told me. And I only hoped. I thank God
you&rsquo;ve got home in time to make me sure. Ariel! If your messenger
should be off to-night, what message shall she take your
father? Make it exact, and I&rsquo;ll impress it on my memory. If only
one could take a letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ariel was swept by terror. Her blood ran icy again, as at dinner.
She tore her eyes from Hugh&rsquo;s startled, puzzled face. Oh,
the aquamarine had told her right. Her darling&rsquo;s agony and
death was coming swiftly&mdash;swiftly&mdash;Tears rose in an agony of
their own in her throat and scalded her cheeks. Her sight
fought through them for a view of the beloved face. Already
Death was slipping over it the mask for agony. But no. The
mask was carelessly put on&mdash;anyhow&mdash;askew. Ariel saw
this.... And then, as if her tears were a clarifying medium&mdash;as
in this case they were&mdash;she saw that under the badly adjusted
mask-for-agony Grandam was smiling.</p>
<p>It was a new sort of smile altogether. It seemed to express
anticipation, a kind of joyous excitement.... Youth....
Love.... An almost <i>shy</i> love.</p>
<p>But the smile was not for Ariel, nor for Hugh. For some one
else entirely.... Some one whose hands Grandam guessed
were about to open the door of her coach and let her out into
Eternity? Or for some one else at the Saint&rsquo;s shoulder? Only
Death knows.</p>
<p>Through salty lips Ariel was sobbing&mdash;&ldquo;Tell Father that I
love him with my whole heart and that I am happy, happy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh knelt. There was no time to get help or to do anything
themselves. He held Grandam up, supported her agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Tell Gregory Clare that I will take
care of his girl as long as we both shall live. Tell him that I
love Ariel. No! Tell him <i>how</i> I love Ariel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they knew&mdash;<i>just</i>&mdash;that Grandam caught their messages.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
